    "target": "You can get a lot of my thoughts from the quarter - by - quarter updates I added to the game thread post . With a game in Utah tomorrow night , I wo n't be writing a super - detailed recap of this one . Not sure what I would write if I wanted to go detailed . It 's like this - I 'm trying to think of questions to ask Kim Hughes in the post game press conference , and there 's nothing to ask . `` Hey coach , why did the team shoot 37 % ? Hey coach , were they trying to make shots ? '' You ca n't win when you shoot 37 % . You ca n't win when your staring backcourt is 5 for 22 . That 's it . That 's the end of the story . It 's especially disappointing coming from Eric Gordon of course . He had unbelievable success against the Thunder last season , so to come out and have one of the worst games of his career is disappointing and surprising . Kim Hughes said in his post game comments that he thinks EJ has a sore leg - that he could see him favoring it , and that he was struggling with his shot and on defense because of it . I guess that 's good news if it explains his extremely sub - par performance - but it 's bad news if it keeps him out of the Utah game . The coach did not know how or when the injury might have occurred . The Thunder remind me a little of the Nuggets on defense ( when the Nuggets are good ) . They are very active and aggressive - reaching in , getting their hands on a ton of balls . They had 13 steals and 11 blocks tonight , and who knows how many more deflections . It 's frustrating when a team does that much reaching , and yet gets called for six fewer fouls . But it does n't mean it 's wrong . Hughes had an interesting take on that subject , at least as concerns the bigs . To set the stage a little , Chris Kaman came out of the game directly after a Restbwook steal on a double team , where Chris clearly felt he had been fouled . Hughes ' point is this - bigs should n't dribble in traffic . If you do , and you get slapped by a point guard , you 're probably not going to get the call , because refs have a sense of how the game is supposed to played also , and they do n't think bigs should be dribbling in traffic . And Hughes does n't want them to get that call , because he does n't want them to dribble in traffic .",

In case you were wondering , the Celtics are 5 - 5 with Kevin Garnett out of the lineup . They are 22 - 7 with him . Did n't see enough of Rondo taking charge in the 2nd half . Nobody will remember this , but Perkins looked very comfortable on the post tonight . Valiant effort by Pierce as usual . The defense disappeared in the 2nd half . Then came the ugly turnovers . Then it was just a train rolling downhill that the C 's could n't stop .",

    "target": "The Los Angeles Lakers couldn’t complete the three - game sweep of their road trip , losing an ugly one to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a frustrating 125 - 99 loss . Andrew Wiggins scored a career - high 47 points , looking every - bit one of the best young players in the league . It didn’t hurt his night that he lived on the charity stripe , making 17 of his 22 free - throws . The Lakers attempted 30 free - throws as a team Minnesota may as well have been playing “Blow the Whistle” all game with how the referees called this one . The Lakers were hit with 31 fouls to the Timberwolves 19 , with some backbreaking whistles going against Los Angeles every time it seemed they were ready to make a push . D’Angelo Russell had one of his worst games of the season , making defensive mistakes early and even riding the bench through a large stretch in the second half while Luke Walton looked for answers elsewhere . He ended the night with seven points and four assists . The Lakers’ starting lineup struggled in the first quarter and it was once again the bench that kept the deficit respectable . Lou Williams scored a team - high 17 points , netting 13 of them in the fourth quarter . Brandon Ingram chipped in 10 , with Jordan Clarkson adding in another 14 . *NEWPARAGRAPH* Karl-Anthony Towns finished with a double - double , scoring 22 points and grabbing 12 rebounds . He also hit a few momentum - stopping three - pointers to halt Lakers’ pushes in their tracks . The purple and gold return to Los Angeles , set to host the Brooklyn Nets . Until then , try to get the ringing out of your ears from both Tom Thibodeau and the zebras screeching all game .",

    "target": "Kenneth Faried led all scorers with 29 points while Danilo Gallinari set a season high in three pointers made hitting 7 of 14 from deep while finishing with 27 points as the Denver Nuggets defeated the crestfallen Lakers of Los Angeles 119 - 101 . Denver raced out to a 27 - 13 lead in the first quarter , but once their shots started falling , the team stopped playing defense and allowed for a 28 - 10 Lakers run that had the Nuggets trailing by 4 in the second quarter . Denver 's bench only scored 8 points in the first three quarters and allowed the best stretches of LA offense in the first and fourth quarters , but Denver 's starting played so well , especially in the third quarter , that it made no difference . After a halftime ceremony honoring Nuggets great , Fat Lever , Denver played inspired defense causing 6 turnovers while holding the Lakers to 17 points while scoring 35 points in a quarter for the second time tonight . Great defense lead to great offense and the game was out of hand heading into the final period . That did n't mean the fourth quarter was n't worth watching . Rookie Gary Harris flashed what is to come from the young Spartan , shooting 4 - 6 including an authoritative slam over Robert Sacre . Will Barton shot too many jumpers off the dribble , but his hustle on the fast break - both offensively and defensively - lead to highlight jams and an impressive block .",

    "target": "The Atlanta Hawks pulled off a wild second half rally Friday night erasing a 20 - point deficit before falling late thanks to an Isaiah Thomas dagger with just 2 seconds remaining . The loss snapped Atlanta’s seven - game winning streak and dropped them 3 games behind the Celtics in the standings but there were plenty of positives that they can take from this game and hopefully build on in the future . “To come back from ... .we were in a pretty big hole there ... .that group kind of found a way to , defensively and offensively , give ourselves a chance , ” Mike Budenholzer told reporters after the game . “They played better for more of the 48 minutes than we did . We had a 15 - minute stretch were a lot of things on both ends of the court , we did pretty well . But for the rest of the game ... .they shot it well . They moved it well . They did a lot of things . It was a heck of a comeback . It was a heck of a game . We’ll learn from it . We’ll be better going forward.” *NEWPARAGRAPH* The first and third quarters were problematic for Atlanta as the Celtics hit them with a barrage of three - point shots . Boston knocked down 8 of 14 attempts in the first quarter to jump out to a 28 - 18 lead at the end of one . After the Hawks fought back in the second to trail 48 - 44 at the half , the Celtics knocked down five more three - pointers to push the lead to as many as 20 points . “I thought the start of the first quarter and start of the third quarter were carbon copies , ” Budenholzer said . “A lot of made three’s . Some were good looks . Some were tough ones . They executed well . Then in the second quarter , end of the third and in the fourth quarter , we were able to get the three - point line a bit under control . To Atlanta’s credit , they fought back and received a contribution from an unlikely group . Boston led 77 - 57 with 3:2 remaining in the third when Budenholzer opted to throw the newly acquired Mike Dunleavy Jr. into the game for the first time . The Hawks closed the quarter with 8 - 1 run to cut the deficit to 78 - 65 entering the fourth . *NEWPARAGRAPH* With momentum in hand , Budenholzer stuck with the reserves in the fourth . “The end of the third quarter , which is normally when we have the second group in . I thought they cut it from 20 to 13 going into the fourth quarter , ” Budenholzer said of the decision to ride the bench down the stretch . “They started the fourth quarter with a good rhythm . They were just playing well . So we just rode that group . They gave us our best chance . We went a little smaller , spread them out , a little more athleticism . At least for a certain stretch , that was helpful.” Tim Hardaway Jr. and Malcolm Delaney combined for 25 points in the fourth quarter and nearly saved Atlanta by themselves . Hardaway scored 15 of his team - high 23 points in the fourth including a three - pointer with just 49 seconds remaining that cut a six - point Celtics lead in half . “We dug ourselves a big hole in the third . At the start of the fourth , we just wanted to cut the lead as the game progressed , ” Hardaway said after the game . It got close at the end and we had an opportunity to come back and win . The last play didn’t go that well . But we did show heart . We got stops on the defensive end . Isaiah Thomas did what he does best , and that’s make big shots.” Paul Millsap connected on a game - tying three with just 26 remaining , but Thomas waved off a time out from his coach Brad Stevens and proceeded to hit the game winner with just 2 seconds remaining . Thomas was a thorn in Atlanta’s side for the entire night finishing with a game - high 28 points to go along with nine - assists . It was a tough game to lose for the Hawks who clearly had this one circled on their calendars coming in . The much anticipated first matchup between Al Horford and Dwight Howard never really developed . Horford finished with 10 points , six rebounds and six assists while Howard tossed in 11 points and eight rebounds but sat the entire fourth quarter when the Hawks went small . Atlanta will enjoy an off day on Saturday before facing an interesting back - to - back that features a pair of afternoon starts . The Hawks will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday at 3 p.m. and then fly to New York for a 1 p.m. matchup on MLK Day against the Knicks .",

The Mavericks outplayed the Grizzlies in several categories, yet curiously still came up well short of a victory. Dallas drained 11 three - pointers to Memphis' seven, and the Mavs also outrebounded the home team 48 to 42. Zaza Pachulia's performance particularly stood out in this regard, as he held his own against one of the best all - around centers in the game in Marc Gasol. Pachulia went toe - to - toe on the glass with the Grizzlies' big man, matching his 10 boards while also collecting 13 points. Veteran Dirk Nowitzki posted a double - double of his own, his second on the season. The veteran power forward totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds, while adding a block and a steal. Deron Williams (10 points) and Wesley Matthews (11 points) made respectable contributions, with the latter draining three three - pointers, giving him seven over the last two contests. Reserves J.J. Barea and Raymond Felton paced the Dallas bench with a pair of 16 - point outings. Felton was notably perfect on three - pointers, draining all four of his shots from beyond the arc. The Mavericks fell to 9 - 6 and currently reside in second place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division. They travel to San Antonio for a Wednesday tilt versus the Spurs. The Grizzlies received a remarkably balanced offensive performance from their starters, something they have significantly lacked in many games this season. Gasol collected 15 points and the aforementioned 10 boards, while point guard Mike Conley continued his recent stretch of resurgent play on offense. The veteran tallied 21 points, six assists, and four rebounds, for his fourth game of 20 points or more in the last five contests. Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes. Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph (knee), pitching in 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki. Mario Chalmers led the Memphis reserves with 14 points, while JaMychal Green made the most of his return to the bench by amassing 13 points over just 17 minutes. The Grizzlies improved to 8 - 7 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division. They head to Houston for a Wednesday showdown versus the Rockets.",

The Grizzlies received a remarkably balanced offensive performance from their starters, something they have significantly lacked in many games this season. Gasol collected 15 points and the aforementioned 10 boards, while point guard Mike Conley continued his recent stretch of resurgent play on offense. The veteran tallied 21 points, six assists, and four rebounds, for his fourth game of 20 points or more in the last five contests. Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes. Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph (knee), pitching in 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki. Mario Chalmers led the Memphis reserves with 14 points, while JaMychal Green made the most of his return to the bench by amassing 13 points over just 17 minutes. The Grizzlies improved to 8 - 7 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division. They head to Houston for a Wednesday showdown versus the Rockets."

Isaiah Thomas was huge for Boston (4 - 4) as he led the way offensively with 29 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting, in only 28 minutes. Thomas went 3 - of - 5 from deep, while the Celtics were great from downtown overall, hitting 11 - of - 27.

Kelly Olynyk was solid in his second game back, with 19 points on 6 - of - 11 shooting, seven rebounds and three assists, in 30 minutes. Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart both filled the stat sheet. Smart finished with 12 points, 10 assists, six rebounds and three steals, while Bradley notched 15 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and four steals. The Celtics move to 3 - 1 at home and will head out for a two - game road trip beginning in Indiana on Saturday. With this loss the Knicks (3 - 5) fall to 1 - 3 on the road and have not achieved consecutive wins once yet this season. They were coming off a good win in Brooklyn but failed to carry that momentum into this one, which may have had something to do with the fact that Carmelo Anthony was ejected mid - second quarter.

Derrick Rose added 11 points, six assists and four rebounds, while the only other player to tally double - digits for the Knicks was Justin Holiday, with 10.

      "Carmelo Anthony scored 12 points in 12 minutes before getting ejected. Only three other players scored in double figures for the Knicks, including Derrick Rose with 11, Kristaps Porzingis with 14 and Justin Hamilton with 10 off the bench. Both teams shot less than 39 percent from the field, while the Celtics managed to hit 40 percent from long range. The Knicks gave up 25 turnovers leading to 27 points for Boston. The teams were matched closely for points in the paint as well as rebounds. Isaiah Thomas filled it up with 29 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting.

The Pelicans had dropped four in a row but are now on a four - game win streak after their victory at Sleep Train Arena. Tyreke Evans was just one assist shy of a triple - double. He had 19 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists. Anthony Davis had 20 points and ten rebounds in another stellar game for the \"Smoothie King Superstar \". New Orleans is just a half a game back of the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth seed in the Western Conference. They could finish as high as the seventh seed but are in danger of missing the playoffs once again. DeMarcus Cousins put up an awe - inspiring performance in another tough loss. Cousins had 24 points, 20 rebounds and 13 assists, all of which were game - highs. He's now put up back - to - back games of 20 - plus points, 20 - plus rebounds and 10 - plus assists from the center position. Russell Westbrook isn't the only one playing out of his mind right now, as Cousins has averaged 28 points, 18 rebounds, 7 assists, 4 blocks and 2 steals over his last four games.

      "The New Orleans Pelicans (41 - 34) defeated the Sacramento Kings (26 - 49) 101 - 95 on Friday. The Pelicans had dropped four in a row but are now on a four - game win streak after their victory at Sleep Train Arena. Tyreke Evans was just one assist shy of a triple - double. He had 19 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists. Anthony Davis had 20 points and ten rebounds in another stellar game for the \"Smoothie King Superstar \". New Orleans is just a half a game back of the Oklahoma City Thunder for the eighth seed in the Western Conference. They could finish as high as the seventh seed but are in danger of missing the playoffs once again. DeMarcus Cousins put up an awe - inspiring performance in another tough loss. Cousins had 24 points, 20 rebounds and 13 assists, all of which were game - highs. He's now put up back - to - back games of 20 - plus points, 20 - plus rebounds and 10 - plus assists from the center position. Russell Westbrook isn't the only one playing out of his mind right now, as Cousins has averaged 28 points, 18 rebounds, 7 assists, 4 blocks and 2 steals over his last four games. The Kings will welcome the Utah Jazz to Sacramento on Sunday, as New Orleans will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday."

The Cardinals are assured of home-field advantage when the NL Division Series starts Thursday . The Cardinals have made it to the postseason 11 times in the past 18 seasons under the ownership group led by chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. A large group of rookies was mixed in with a veteran core , and they overcame injuries to Chris Carpenter , Jason Motte , Jaime Garcia and Rafael Furcal . Adam Wainwright ( 18 - 9 ) was moved up to start Saturday , putting the St. Louis ace on track to start his team 's postseason opener against Cincinnati , Pittsburgh or the Los Angeles Dodgers . A near-sellout crowd of 44,030 was on its feet , roaring and clapping in unison the final half-inning , then snapping pictures and applauding while the team celebrated near the mound . After the final out , Cardinals players put on T-shirts that read : `` We Own The Central . '' The Cubs have lost 12 of 16 and watched an opponent clinch for the third time in a week . The Braves wrapped up the NL East on Sunday at Wrigley Field , and the Pirates secured a playoff spot in Chicago the following day . Lynn ( 15 - 10 ) began his strikeout streak with Dioner Navarro to end the first . He fanned seven his first time through the order , and allowed just four hits over six innings with nine strikeouts and no walks . Lynn has won consecutive starts after a skid in which he was 0 - 5 with a 5.44 ERA in eight outings . Cubs leadoff man Starlin Castro had three hits , including a third-inning single that stopped Lynn 's strikeout streak . Yadier Molina had two hits and three RBIs to set his season best with 78 , Jon Jay had two hits and an RBI , and leadoff man Matt Carpenter had a single that left him one hit shy of 200 . Travis Wood ( 9 - 12 ) gave up three runs and four hits , leaving after just one inning -- when he reached 200 in a season for the first time . After Wood 's running catch in foul territory on Carlos Beltran 's foul pop , six batters reached safely with two out . Molina had a two - run double off the left-field wall , and Jay extended his hitting streak to 12 with an RBI single . Holliday hit his 250th career homer and 21st this season leading off the sixth off Blake Parker .",

    "target": "ANAHEIM , Calif. -- For Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter , the best seat in the house was right in front of the television in the visiting clubhouse . Nick Markakis hit a two - run single in the eighth inning and a run-scoring single in the 10th to help the Orioles beat the Los Angeles Angels 3 - 2 on Sunday , after Showalter was ejected in the sixth for arguing balls and strikes . Angels right-hander Dan Haren threw 73 of his 115 pitches for strikes , several of which did n't sit well with Showalter , who was run by umpire Angel Campos after Markakis fell behind 0 - 1 in the count . Markakis eventually was called out on strikes to end the sixth . Showalter 's ejection was the 20th of his career and first this season . Angels reliever LaTroy Hawkins ( 0 - 1 ) came on in the 10th and immediately walked to No . 9 hitter Robert Andino , who advanced on a sacrifice by Endy Chavez and a groundout by J. J. Hardy . Markakis then grounded a hard single up the middle that deflected off the glove of second baseman Howie Kendrick and into center field . Pedro Strop ( 2 - 1 ) pitched two innings for the win despite allowing a tying solo homer in the eighth by Kendrick . Jim Johnson got three outs for his seventh save . Haren was charged with two runs and six hits over 7 1/3 innings and struck out eight in his fourth start . The three - time All-Star , still looking for his first victory , took a 1 - 0 lead into the eighth before giving up one - out singles by pinch-hitter Matt Wieters and Andino . Chavez greeted lefty Scott Downs with a bloop single on an 0 - 2 pitch , loading the bases , before Downs turned Hardy 's comebacker into a force at the plate . But the left-hander fell behind Markakis 2 - 0 and Markakis put the Orioles ahead 2 - 1 with a two - run single through the left side of the infield -- his first two RBIs in a span of 37 at-bats . Kendrick pulled the Angels even in the bottom half with his one - out opposite-field homer to right , the first by the Angels in a span of 42 innings and just their second home run in 58 innings . It also ended a string of 36 straight homerless innings by Baltimore pitchers . Wei-Yin Chen held the Angels to a run and five hits over 6 1/3 innings and struck out five in his third major league start . The Taiwanese left-hander was lifted by bench coach John Russell after giving up a pair of one - out walks . Albert Pujols was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts and remained homerless in his 16 games and 65 at-bats , the longest drought from the start of a season in his 12-year career . He started as the designated hitter for the first time since joining the Angels .",

Cheered on by his wife in the stands , Kershaw ( 7 - 2 ) retired his first 18 batters before Corey Dickerson led off the seventh with a slow bouncer to Ramirez .

But that was it for the Rockies against Kershaw , who shrugged off the miscue . One batter after Dickerson reached base , rookie third baseman Miguel Rojas backhanded Troy Tulowitzki 's grounder behind the bag and let fly with a strong throw to first that Gonzalez -- a three - time Gold Glove winner -- scooped out of the dirt to keep the no-hitter intact .

Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax , who tossed four no-hitters , pitched the franchise 's only perfect game on Sept. 9 , 1965 , against the Chicago Cubs . Ramirez was back in the lineup after leaving Tuesday night 's game with a bruised ring finger on his throwing hand , the result of a sharp grounder by Dickerson than deflected into short center field for a double . Ramirez was replaced on defense by rookie Carlos Triunfel to start the eighth . Kershaw missed more than six weeks early this year because of a strained muscle in his upper back , after beating Arizona in the season opener during the Dodgers ' two - game trip to Australia .

    "target": "MINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) -- Cliff Lee was cruising , and the Cleveland Indians were on the verge of a much-needed victory . Then came the seventh inning , and a sign of just how fragile the defending AL Central champions currently are . The Twins took full advantage , using a handful of walks and well-placed singles to send the Indians to their eighth straight loss Sunday . Carlos Gomez capped the three - run seventh against Lee with an RBI groundout , and Minnesota rallied for a 4 - 3 victory over Cleveland . Lee ( 11 - 2 ) lost for the first time in nine starts , hurt by a rare lack of control in the seventh that helped the resourceful Twins put together another one of their small-ball rallies . They batted eight times that inning and hit the ball out of the infield twice . Since losing 12 - 2 to the Indians in Cleveland on June 12 , the Twins are 18 - 3 . They have swept four of their last six series . The surge looks more impressive upon examination of the recent list of losing opposing pitchers : Lee , Ben Sheets , Greg Maddux , Trevor Hoffman , Brandon Webb and Randy Johnson . Perkins allowed seven hits in seven innings before turning the lead over to Matt Guerrier and Joe Nathan , who celebrated his third All-Star selection by pitching a perfect ninth for this 25th save . Perkins , who has n't lost in seven starts since May 30 , has been one of Minnesota 's most consistent starters . The left-hander has allowed three runs or less in his last six appearances . Lee needed 37 pitches to finish the seventh . He walked two , including Denard Span with the bases loaded , and wasted a 3 - 1 lead cushioned by Jhonny Peralta 's two - run homer in the sixth . Lee had issued just 17 walks in 111 2/3 innings all season before Sunday . Until Span started the sixth with a triple , the only hits by the Twins did n't leave the infield -- a popped-up bunt by Alexi Casilla that just cleared Lee 's head and a grounder that Gomez beat out , drawing a brief argument about the call from Wedge . Lee struck out Gomez after Span 's triple and traded an out for a run when Casilla hit a grounder to shortstop , still taking a 3 - 1 lead into the seventh . But with one out , Craig Monroe walked .

      "MINNEAPOLIS ( AP ) -- Cliff Lee was cruising , and the Cleveland Indians were on the verge of a much-needed victory . Then came the seventh inning , and a sign of just how fragile the defending AL Central champions currently are . The Twins took full advantage , using a handful of walks and well-placed singles to send the Indians to their eighth straight loss Sunday . Carlos Gomez capped the three - run seventh against Lee with an RBI groundout , and Minnesota rallied for a 4 - 3 victory over Cleveland . Lee ( 11 - 2 ) lost for the first time in nine starts , hurt by a rare lack of control in the seventh that helped the resourceful Twins put together another one of their small-ball rallies . They batted eight times that inning and hit the ball out of the infield twice . Since losing 12 - 2 to the Indians in Cleveland on June 12 , the Twins are 18 - 3 . They have swept four of their last six series . The surge looks more impressive upon examination of the recent list of losing opposing pitchers : Lee , Ben Sheets , Greg Maddux , Trevor Hoffman , Brandon Webb and Randy Johnson . Perkins allowed seven hits in seven innings before turning the lead over to Matt Guerrier and Joe Nathan , who celebrated his third All-Star selection by pitching a perfect ninth for this 25th save . Perkins , who has n't lost in seven starts since May 30 , has been one of Minnesota 's most consistent starters . The left-hander has allowed three runs or less in his last six appearances . Lee needed 37 pitches to finish the seventh . He walked two , including Denard Span with the bases loaded , and wasted a 3 - 1 lead cushioned by Jhonny Peralta 's two - run homer in the sixth . Lee had issued just 17 walks in 111 2/3 innings all season before Sunday . Until Span started the sixth with a triple , the only hits by the Twins did n't leave the infield -- a popped-up bunt by Alexi Casilla that just cleared Lee 's head and a grounder that Gomez beat out , drawing a brief argument about the call from Wedge . Lee struck out Gomez after Span 's triple and traded an out for a run when Casilla hit a grounder to shortstop , still taking a 3 - 1 lead into the seventh . But with one out , Craig Monroe walked . Delmon Young reached on an infield single when third baseman Andy Marte lost the ball trying to pull it from his glove after a diving stop and a spin move left him on the ground . Brendan Harris followed with a single to load the bases , and Nick Punto pulled the Twins within one with his base hit on a 3 - 1 pitch . Lee went to a 3 - 1 count again on Span , and ball four tied the game . Gomez gave Minnesota its first lead on his groundout to shortstop . Lee was critical of himself , especially for the bases-loaded walk to Span , but he still found a way to be optimistic . The Indians are off Monday , a welcome respite after a miserable weekend made worse by the uncertainty of C. C. Sabathia 's status amid trade talks the team is having regarding the big left-hander ."
