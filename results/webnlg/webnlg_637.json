Ensure all data points are included and clearly presented. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured text outline or paragraph that includes all information about Bedford Aerodrome.\n- Present the ICAO location identifier, elevation above sea level, and runway name in a way that is easy to follow and sets up the next stage for fluent text realization.\n- Do not omit or add any information.\n- Output the structured text, ready for surface realization.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | icaoLocationIdentifier | EGBF\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 83.2104\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | runwayName | \"08/26\"\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Bedford_Aerodrome | icaoLocationIdentifier | EGBF', 'Bedford_Aerodrome | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 83.2104', 'Bedford_Aerodrome | runwayName | \"08/26\"']\n- Structured Text: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | icaoLocationIdentifier | EGBF\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 83.2104\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | runwayName | \"08/26\"\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Transform the structured text into a fluent, natural-sounding paragraph that includes all the provided information about Bedford Aerodrome. Ensure the output is grammatically correct, clear, and does not omit or add any information. \nAdditional Instruction: - Write a fluent, coherent paragraph that presents all the facts: the ICAO location identifier (EGBF), the elevation above sea level (83.2104), and the runway name (\"08/26\") for Bedford Aerodrome.\n- Do not omit any data or add extra information.\n- Ensure the text is clear, natural, and grammatically correct.\n- Output only the final paragraph, ready for user delivery.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nBedford Aerodrome has the ICAO location identifier EGBF.
