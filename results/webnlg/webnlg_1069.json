Ensure all data fields are represented and no information is omitted or added. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured text outline or paragraph skeleton.\n- Ensure each data point (starring, director, writer, gross) is clearly represented.\n- Do not add, omit, or alter any information from the ordered content.\n- Prepare the output so it is ready for the surface realization stage, where it will be converted into fluent, natural language text.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | starring | Adam_West\n    Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)\n    Super_Capers | writer | Ray_Griggs_(director)\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | gross | 30955.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Super_Capers | starring | Adam_West', 'Super_Capers | writer | Ray_Griggs_(director)', 'Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)', 'Super_Capers | gross | 30955.0']\n- Structured Text Output: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | starring | Adam_West\n    Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)\n    Super_Capers | writer | Ray_Griggs_(director)\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | gross | 30955.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Convert the structured text into fluent, natural language sentences.
