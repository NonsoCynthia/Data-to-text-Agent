I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the ordered content, the structured content, and clear instructions to ensure all information is included without omission or hallucination. \nInstruction:\n- Convert the structured content into fluent, natural, and grammatically correct English text.\n- Ensure all information is included: the film title (\"McVeagh of the South Seas\"), the starring actor (Harry Carey, actor born 1878), the producer (The Progressive Motion Picture Company), and the IMDb ID (0004319).\n- Do not omit or invent any information.\n- The final text should be clear, coherent, and ready for presentation to a user. \n\nWorker Input: Original Data: \n['McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | imdbId | 0004319', \n 'McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | starring | Harry_Carey_(actor_born_1878)', \n 'McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | producer | The_Progressive_Motion_Picture_Company']\n\nOrdered Content: \n['McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | starring | Harry_Carey_(actor_born_1878)', \n 'McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | producer | The_Progressive_Motion_Picture_Company', \n 'McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | imdbId | 0004319']\n\nStructured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | starring | Harry_Carey_(actor_born_1878)\n    McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | producer | The_Progressive_Motion_Picture_Company\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas | imdbId | 0004319\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n\nNo prior guardrail feedback requiring correction.', instruction='- Convert the structured content into fluent, natural, and grammatically correct English text.\n- Ensure all information is included: the film title (\"McVeagh of the South Seas\"), the starring actor (Harry Carey, actor born 1878), the producer (The Progressive Motion Picture Company), and the IMDb ID (0004319).\n- Do not omit or invent any information.\n- The final text should be clear, coherent, and ready for presentation to a user. \n\nWorker Output: McVeagh of the South Seas stars Harry Carey, the actor born in 1878, and was produced by The Progressive Motion Picture Company.
