Ensure all information is included and no extra information is added. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered facts to create a structured text outline (such as a paragraph or bullet points).\n- Ensure the structure is logical and prepares the content for fluent, natural language realization in the next stage.\n- Do not generate the final text yet; focus on organizing the information clearly and completely.\n- Do not omit any data or add any new information.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | releaseDate | 2001-10-16\n    Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | runtime | 230.05\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | releaseDate | 2001-10-16', 'Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | runtime | 230.05']\n- Ordered Content: ['Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | releaseDate | 2001-10-16', 'Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | runtime | 230.05']\n- Structured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | releaseDate | 2001-10-16\n    Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | runtime | 230.05\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for surface realization.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, natural language paragraph that accurately conveys all the information from the data, without omitting any details or adding extra information. \nAdditional Instruction: - Transform the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and readable paragraph.\n- Ensure that both the release date and runtime of \"Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes\" are clearly and accurately mentioned.\n- Do not omit any information or add any details not present in the original data.\n- The output should be a single, coherent paragraph suitable for a general audience.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nBootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes was released on October 16, 2001, and has a runtime of 230.05 minutes.\n-- OUTPUT END --\nFinalizer Agent: Carefully review the output provided above by the surface realization agent.
