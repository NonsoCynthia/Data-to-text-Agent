The feedback also suggests that each triple should be expressed as a distinct sentence or logically grouped (e.g., engine and powerType together, length separate). To address this, I will reassign the task to the 'text structuring' worker, instructing them to convert each triple into a natural language sentence or logically grouped sentences, using <snt> tags for each. The output should not repeat the triple format but instead present the information in a way that prepares for fluent surface realization. \nInstruction:\n- Convert each triple into a natural language sentence or logically group related facts into a single sentence, using <snt> tags for each sentence.\n- Do not repeat the triple format; instead, express the information in a way that prepares for fluent surface realization.\n- For example, you may group the engine and powerType into one sentence, and the length into another, or use three separate sentences.\n- Ensure all information from the triples is included and clearly presented.\n- Do not add any information not present in the input.\n- Output should be in a <paragraph> tag, with each sentence in its own <snt> tag. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['ALCO_RS-3 | engine | Four-stroke_engine', 'ALCO_RS-3 | powerType | Diesel-electric_transmission', 'ALCO_RS-3 | length | 17068.8 (millimetres)']\n- Ordered Triples: ['ALCO_RS-3 | engine | Four-stroke_engine', 'ALCO_RS-3 | powerType | Diesel-electric_transmission', 'ALCO_RS-3 | length | 17068.8 (millimetres)']\n- Previous Output: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    ALCO_RS-3 | engine | Four-stroke_engine\n    ALCO_RS-3 | powerType | Diesel-electric_transmission\n    ALCO_RS-3 | length | 17068.8 (millimetres)\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: The output includes all triples, but all three are grouped into a single <snt> (sentence) tag, which is not appropriate since each triple represents a distinct fact that would not naturally form a single sentence.
