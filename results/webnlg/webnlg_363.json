The next step is to move to the text structuring stage, where the ordered data will be organized into a structured textual format (such as a paragraph or list) in preparation for surface realization. I will provide the text structuring worker with the original data, the ordered content, and clear instructions to ensure all information is included and logically grouped. \nInstruction:\n- Organize the ordered content into a clear and logical textual structure suitable for generating a fluent paragraph about the film \"It's Great to Be Young (1956 film)\".\n- Group related information (such as director, cast, crew, runtime, and gross) together in a way that would make sense in a natural text.\n- Do not omit any data or add any new information.\n- Clearly indicate the structure (e.g., as a paragraph outline or bullet points) for the next stage.\n- Ensure the structure is ready for surface realization into fluent text. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: \n  [\"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | John_Mills\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | cinematography | Gilbert_Taylor\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | runtime | 94.0\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | gross | 282838.0\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | musicComposer | Louis_Levy\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\"]\n- Ordered Content: \n  [\"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | John_Mills\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | musicComposer | Louis_Levy\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | cinematography | Gilbert_Taylor\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | runtime | 94.0\", \n   \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | gross | 282838.0\"]\n- No prior pipeline results or guardrail feedback for this stage.', instruction='- Organize the ordered content into a clear and logical textual structure suitable for generating a fluent paragraph about the film \"It's Great to Be Young (1956 film)\".\n- Group related information (such as director, cast, crew, runtime, and gross) together in a way that would make sense in a natural text.\n- Do not omit any data or add any new information.\n- Clearly indicate the structure (e.g., as a paragraph outline or bullet points) for the next stage.\n- Ensure the structure is ready for surface realization into fluent text. \n\nWorker Output: <paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | John_Mills\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | musicComposer | Louis_Levy\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | cinematography | Gilbert_Taylor\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | runtime | 94.0\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | gross | 282838.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n\nKeep your reply concise, avoid repetition, and use the following format:\nFEEDBACK:\n",
