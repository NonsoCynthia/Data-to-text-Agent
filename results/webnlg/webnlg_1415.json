Ensure all data points are included and clearly represented. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured text outline or paragraph skeleton.\n- Group related information (e.g., discovery details together, then physical properties).\n- Do not omit or add any information.\n- Prepare the structure so it is ready for surface realization into fluent text in the next stage.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    1147_Stavropolis | discovered | 1929-06-11\n    1147_Stavropolis | discoverer | Grigory_Neujmin\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    1147_Stavropolis | absoluteMagnitude | 11.5\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['1147_Stavropolis | discoverer | Grigory_Neujmin', '1147_Stavropolis | absoluteMagnitude | 11.5', '1147_Stavropolis | discovered | 1929-06-11']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    1147_Stavropolis | discovered | 1929-06-11\n    1147_Stavropolis | discoverer | Grigory_Neujmin\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    1147_Stavropolis | absoluteMagnitude | 11.5\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback requiring revision.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and readable paragraph.
