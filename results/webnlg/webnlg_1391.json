Ensure that all data points are included and that the structure supports readability and coherence. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered data points to create a structured text outline or paragraph.\n- Ensure each data point is represented clearly and logically.\n- Do not omit any information or add new content.\n- Prepare the structured text so it is ready for surface realization (final fluent text generation).\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | campus | Dijon\n    University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | staff | 2900\n    University_of_Burgundy | numberOfDoctoralStudents | 1299\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['University_of_Burgundy | staff | 2900', 'University_of_Burgundy | numberOfDoctoralStudents | 1299', 'University_of_Burgundy | campus | Dijon', 'University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon']\n- Ordered Data: ['University_of_Burgundy | campus | Dijon', 'University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon', 'University_of_Burgundy | staff | 2900', 'University_of_Burgundy | numberOfDoctoralStudents | 1299']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | campus | Dijon\n    University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | staff | 2900\n    University_of_Burgundy | numberOfDoctoralStudents | 1299\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage. \nAdditional Instruction: - Convert the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding paragraph.\n- Ensure all data points are included: the University of Burgundy's campus and city (Dijon), staff count (2900), and number of doctoral students (1299).\n- Do not add any information not present in the data.\n- The final text should be clear, coherent, and ready for presentation.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nThe University of Burgundy is located in Dijon, with its campus also situated in the same city.
