Output the structured content, ready for the surface realization stage.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Al_Asad_Airbase | operatingOrganisation | United_States_Air_Force\n    Al_Asad_Airbase | runwayLength | 3992.88\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Al_Asad_Airbase | operatingOrganisation | United_States_Air_Force', 'Al_Asad_Airbase | runwayLength | 3992.88']\n- Structured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Al_Asad_Airbase | operatingOrganisation | United_States_Air_Force\n    Al_Asad_Airbase | runwayLength | 3992.88\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior pipeline results or guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Transform the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding English sentence or short paragraph.\n- Expectation: The output should accurately express both facts (the operating organization and the runway length of Al Asad Airbase), be clear and readable, and not introduce any information not present in the data. \nAdditional Instruction: 1. Convert the structured content into a natural, fluent English sentence or short paragraph.\n2. Ensure both facts are clearly and accurately conveyed: (a) Al Asad Airbase is operated by the United States Air Force, and (b) its runway length is 3992.88 (units not specified, so do not invent).\n3. Do not add, omit, or alter any information from the original data.\n4. Ensure the text is grammatically correct and easy to read.\n5. Output only the final realized text, ready for user delivery.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nAl Asad Airbase is operated by the United States Air Force and has a runway length of 3992.88.\n-- OUTPUT END --\nFinalizer Agent: Carefully review the output provided above by the surface realization agent. Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
