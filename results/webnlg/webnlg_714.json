Ensure that all information is included and no extra information is added. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured text outline or draft (such as a paragraph or bullet points) that presents all the facts about Ciudad Ayala.\n- Do not omit any data or introduce new information.\n- Make sure the structure is clear and will support fluent, natural language realization in the next stage.\n- Output the structured text, ready for surface realization.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Ciudad_Ayala | governmentType | Council-manager_government\n    Ciudad_Ayala | populationDensity | 1604.0\n    Ciudad_Ayala | utcOffset | \u22126\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Ciudad_Ayala | governmentType | Council-manager_government', 'Ciudad_Ayala | populationDensity | 1604.0', 'Ciudad_Ayala | utcOffset | \u22126']\n- Structured Text: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Ciudad_Ayala | governmentType | Council-manager_government\n    Ciudad_Ayala | populationDensity | 1604.0\n    Ciudad_Ayala | utcOffset | \u22126\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: All triples are present and included within a single <snt> inside a <paragraph>, with no omissions or additions. The structure is well-formed and valid.\n- Task: Transform the structured text into a fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding paragraph. Ensure that all information from the original data is included, and do not add any extra information. \nAdditional Instruction: - Convert the structured content into a coherent and fluent paragraph in natural English.\n- Mention all three facts: the government type, the population density, and the UTC offset of Ciudad Ayala.\n- Do not omit any data or introduce new information.\n- Ensure the text is clear, readable, and free from grammatical errors.\n- Output only the final, fluent text.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nCiudad Ayala operates under a council-manager form of government.

Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
