The guardrail feedback confirms that the structure is well-formed and valid, and there are no outstanding issues. According to the workflow policy, I should now proceed to the surface realization stage. The next worker should be provided with the original data, the structured content, and clear instructions to generate a fluent, coherent, and natural-sounding text that accurately conveys all the information without adding or omitting any details. \nInstruction:\n- Convert the structured content into a well-written paragraph that includes all the provided information about \"Death on a Factory Farm\".\n- Clearly state the producer, editor, music composer, and runtime.\n- Ensure the text is fluent, coherent, and free of grammatical errors.\n- Do not omit any fields or invent new information.\n- The final output should be a single, natural-sounding paragraph suitable for a general audience. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Tom_Simon', 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | editor | Geof_Bartz', 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | musicComposer | Jamie_Lawrence', 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | runtime | 83.0']\n- Structured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Tom_Simon\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | editor | Geof_Bartz\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | musicComposer | Jamie_Lawrence\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | runtime | 83.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: All triples are present and included within a single <snt> inside a <paragraph>, with no omissions or additions.
