Ensure all data points are included and logically connected. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered data to create a structured text outline or paragraph skeleton about Olga Bondareva.\n- Ensure the structure flows naturally, connecting her professional field, notable achievement, and educational background.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new content.\n- Prepare the output so it is ready for surface realization into fluent text in the next stage.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | professionalField | Economics\n    Olga_Bondareva | knownFor | Bondareva\u2013Shapley_theorem\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | almaMater | Leningrad_State_University\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Olga_Bondareva | knownFor | Bondareva\u2013Shapley_theorem', 'Olga_Bondareva | almaMater | Leningrad_State_University', 'Olga_Bondareva | professionalField | Economics']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | professionalField | Economics\n    Olga_Bondareva | knownFor | Bondareva\u2013Shapley_theorem\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | almaMater | Leningrad_State_University\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (previous stage)\n- No prior surface realization attempts.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and readable paragraph about Olga Bondareva. Ensure all information from the original data is included and accurately represented. Do not add any information not present in the data. \nAdditional Instruction: - Write a natural, coherent paragraph about Olga Bondareva, ensuring you mention her professional field (Economics), her notable achievement (Bondareva\u2013Shapley theorem), and her alma mater (Leningrad State University).\n- Do not omit any data points or introduce new information.\n- Ensure the text is fluent, clear, and suitable for a general audience.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nOlga Bondareva is known for her work in the field of Economics, particularly for the Bondareva\u2013Shapley theorem.
