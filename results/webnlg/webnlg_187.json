Do not omit any data or add any new information. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered triples to create a structured text format (preferably a concise paragraph or a well-organized list).\n- Ensure all three data points (build date, cylinder count, length) are included and clearly presented.\n- Do not add, omit, or alter any information.\n- The output should be ready for the surface realization stage, so focus on clarity and logical grouping of information.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    ALCO_RS-3 | buildDate | \"May 1950 - August 1956\"\n    ALCO_RS-3 | cylinderCount | 12\n    ALCO_RS-3 | length | 17068.8 (millimetres)\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['ALCO_RS-3 | buildDate | \"May 1950 - August 1956\"', 'ALCO_RS-3 | cylinderCount | 12', 'ALCO_RS-3 | length | 17068.8 (millimetres)']\n- Structured Output: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    ALCO_RS-3 | buildDate | \"May 1950 - August 1956\"\n    ALCO_RS-3 | cylinderCount | 12\n    ALCO_RS-3 | length | 17068.8 (millimetres)\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (previous stage)\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and readable paragraph.
