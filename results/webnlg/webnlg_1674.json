Output the structured text, ready for the surface realization stage.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | runtime | 94.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: [\"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | runtime | 94.0\", \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\"]\n- Structured Text: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | runtime | 94.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and readable sentence or short paragraph.\n- Expectation: The final text must mention both the director (Cyril Frankel) and the runtime (94 minutes) of the film \"It's Great to Be Young (1956 film)\", using natural language. Do not add any information not present in the data. \nAdditional Instruction: 1. Write a fluent and natural sentence or short paragraph that includes all the information from the structured text.\n2. Clearly state that \"It's Great to Be Young (1956 film)\" was directed by Cyril Frankel and has a runtime of 94 minutes.\n3. Do not add any extra information or omit any required details.\n4. Ensure the text is grammatically correct and easy to read.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n\"It's Great to Be Young (1956 film)\" was directed by Cyril Frankel and has a runtime of 94 minutes.\n-- OUTPUT END --\nFinalizer Agent: Carefully review the output provided above by the surface realization agent. Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
