The worker's task is to generate a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct biographical summary of Olga Bondareva, ensuring that all information is included and no hallucinations or omissions occur. \nInstruction:\n- Transform the structured text into a natural, readable paragraph suitable for a biographical summary.\n- Ensure all data points (birth date, birth place, known for, death place) are included and accurately represented.\n- Do not add, omit, or alter any information.\n- The output should be a single, fluent paragraph that is clear and free of grammatical errors. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Olga_Bondareva | deathPlace | Saint_Petersburg', 'Olga_Bondareva | birthPlace | Leningrad,_USSR', 'Olga_Bondareva | birthDate | 1937-04-27', 'Olga_Bondareva | knownFor | Bondareva\u2013Shapley_theorem']\n- Ordered Content: ['Olga_Bondareva | birthDate | 1937-04-27', 'Olga_Bondareva | birthPlace | Leningrad,_USSR', 'Olga_Bondareva | knownFor | Bondareva\u2013Shapley_theorem', 'Olga_Bondareva | deathPlace | Saint_Petersburg']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | birthDate | 1937-04-27\n    Olga_Bondareva | birthPlace | Leningrad,_USSR\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | knownFor | Bondareva\u2013Shapley_theorem\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | deathPlace | Saint_Petersburg\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (all information is present and correctly structured)\n- Task: Produce a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct biographical summary of Olga Bondareva, ensuring all information from the structured text is included and no extra or omitted content is present.', instruction='- Transform the structured text into a natural, readable paragraph suitable for a biographical summary.\n- Ensure all data points (birth date, birth place, known for, death place) are included and accurately represented.\n- Do not add, omit, or alter any information.\n- The output should be a single, fluent paragraph that is clear and free of grammatical errors. \n\nWorker Output: Olga Bondareva was born on April 27, 1937, in Leningrad, USSR.
