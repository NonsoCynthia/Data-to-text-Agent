The worker's task is to generate a fluent, natural, and grammatically correct paragraph that conveys all the information without omitting any facts or introducing hallucinations. \nInstruction:\n- Transform the structured content into a fluent, natural, and grammatically correct paragraph.\n- Ensure all facts are included: \"Expect a Miracle\" is an album by Brian Kelly (composer & pianist), who is also the producer; the runtime is 54.56 minutes; it was preceded by the album \"Pools of Light\" by Brian Kelly.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new details.\n- The output should be a single, coherent paragraph suitable for a general audience. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Expect_a_Miracle | producer | Brian_Kelly_(composer_&_pianist)', 'Expect_a_Miracle | runtime | 54.56', 'Expect_a_Miracle | artist | Brian_Kelly_(composer_&_pianist)', 'Expect_a_Miracle | precededBy | Pools_of_Light_(Brian_Kelly_album)']\n- Ordered Facts: ['Expect_a_Miracle | artist | Brian_Kelly_(composer_&_pianist)', 'Expect_a_Miracle | producer | Brian_Kelly_(composer_&_pianist)', 'Expect_a_Miracle | runtime | 54.56', 'Expect_a_Miracle | precededBy | Pools_of_Light_(Brian_Kelly_album)']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Expect_a_Miracle | artist | Brian_Kelly_(composer_&_pianist)\n    Expect_a_Miracle | producer | Brian_Kelly_(composer_&_pianist)\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Expect_a_Miracle | runtime | 54.56\n    Expect_a_Miracle | precededBy | Pools_of_Light_(Brian_Kelly_album)\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (text structuring is accurate and complete)\n- No prior surface realization attempts.', instruction='- Transform the structured content into a fluent, natural, and grammatically correct paragraph.\n- Ensure all facts are included: \"Expect a Miracle\" is an album by Brian Kelly (composer & pianist), who is also the producer; the runtime is 54.56 minutes; it was preceded by the album \"Pools of Light\" by Brian Kelly.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new details.\n- The output should be a single, coherent paragraph suitable for a general audience. \n\nWorker Output: Expect a Miracle is an album by Brian Kelly, the composer and pianist, who also served as its producer.
