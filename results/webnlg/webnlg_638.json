Ensure all data points are included and no information is omitted or invented. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured text outline or paragraph that presents all the information about Ciudad Ayala.\n- Group related information (such as both time zones) together in the structure.\n- Ensure the structure is logical and would support a fluent, natural-sounding final text.\n- Do not omit any data or add any new information.\n- Output the structured text, ready for the surface realization stage.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Ciudad_Ayala | timeZone | Pacific_Standard_Time_Zone\n    Ciudad_Ayala | timeZone | Pacific_Daylight_Time\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Ciudad_Ayala | populationDensity | 1604.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Ciudad_Ayala | timeZone | Pacific_Daylight_Time', 'Ciudad_Ayala | populationDensity | 1604.0', 'Ciudad_Ayala | timeZone | Pacific_Standard_Time_Zone']\n- Ordered Content: ['Ciudad_Ayala | timeZone | Pacific_Standard_Time_Zone', 'Ciudad_Ayala | timeZone | Pacific_Daylight_Time', 'Ciudad_Ayala | populationDensity | 1604.0']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Ciudad_Ayala | timeZone | Pacific_Standard_Time_Zone\n    Ciudad_Ayala | timeZone | Pacific_Daylight_Time\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Ciudad_Ayala | populationDensity | 1604.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage. \nAdditional Instruction: - Convert the structured text into a fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding paragraph.\n- Clearly state that Ciudad Ayala is in both the Pacific Standard Time Zone and the Pacific Daylight Time.\n- Include the population density of 1604.0, ensuring it is presented in a natural way.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new facts.\n- Ensure the final text is coherent, readable, and suitable for end-user consumption.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nCiudad Ayala is located in both the Pacific Standard Time Zone and the Pacific Daylight Time.

Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness.
