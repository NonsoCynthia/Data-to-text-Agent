The guardrail feedback is 'CORRECT', confirming that the output is both complete and accurate. The next step in the pipeline is surface realization, where the focus will be on ensuring the final text is fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding. I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the structured text, and clear instructions to further refine the output if necessary. \nInstruction:\n- Carefully review the structured sentence for fluency, clarity, and grammatical correctness.\n- Make minor adjustments if necessary to improve naturalness, but do not change the factual content.\n- Output the final, fluent text as a single, well-formed sentence.\n- Ensure the result is ready for final delivery. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Morelos | isPartOf | Cuernavaca']\n- Structured Text: \n  <paragraph>\n    <snt>\n      Morelos is a part of Cuernavaca.\n    </snt>\n  </paragraph>\n- Previous Output: \n  <paragraph>\n    <snt>\n      Morelos is a part of Cuernavaca.\n    </snt>\n  </paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (from previous stage)\n- Task: Review and, if needed, refine the structured text to ensure the final output is fluent, natural, and grammatically correct.
