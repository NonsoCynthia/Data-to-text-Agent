The runway facts were grouped correctly, but the overall structure needs to ensure that only closely related facts are grouped, and the order from the ordered facts list is strictly followed. To address this, I will reassign the task to 'text structuring', providing explicit instructions to group only directly related facts, maintain the given order, and avoid combining facts about different entities in the same sentence or group. \nInstruction:\n1. Structure the ordered facts into a clear, organized textual outline, strictly preserving the order: \n   ['Bedford_Aerodrome | location | Thurleigh', 'Bedford_Aerodrome | runwayName | \"08/26\"', 'Bedford_Aerodrome | runwaySurfaceType | Concrete', 'Thurleigh | areaCode | 01234'].\n2. Group only directly related facts together in the same sentence or bullet point (e.g., runway facts about Bedford Aerodrome can be grouped, but do not combine facts about Bedford Aerodrome and Thurleigh in the same group).\n3.
