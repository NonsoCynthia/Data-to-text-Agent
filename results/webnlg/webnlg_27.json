Ensure all facts are included, clearly presented, and logically connected. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered facts to create a structured text outline or paragraph that presents all information about Lady Anne Monson.\n- Ensure the structure is coherent and would support fluent, natural language in the final realization.\n- Do not omit any facts or add new information.\n- Clearly indicate the structure (e.g., as a paragraph or bullet points) and maintain logical flow between the facts.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Lady_Anne_Monson | professionalField | Botany\n    Lady_Anne_Monson | spouse | George_Monson\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Lady_Anne_Monson | deathDate | 1776-02-18\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Lady_Anne_Monson | spouse | George_Monson', 'Lady_Anne_Monson | deathDate | 1776-02-18', 'Lady_Anne_Monson | professionalField | Botany']\n- Ordered Facts: ['Lady_Anne_Monson | professionalField | Botany', 'Lady_Anne_Monson | spouse | George_Monson', 'Lady_Anne_Monson | deathDate | 1776-02-18']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Lady_Anne_Monson | professionalField | Botany\n    Lady_Anne_Monson | spouse | George_Monson\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Lady_Anne_Monson | deathDate | 1776-02-18\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (text structuring stage)\n- No prior surface realization attempts or feedback. \nAdditional Instruction: - Convert the structured content into a fluent, natural-sounding paragraph about Lady Anne Monson.\n- Ensure all facts are included: her professional field (Botany), her spouse (George Monson), and her date of death (February 18, 1776).\n- Do not omit any information or add any details not present in the data.\n- The final text should be grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read.\n- Avoid listing facts mechanically; instead, integrate them smoothly into a single, well-formed paragraph.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nLady Anne Monson was involved in the field of botany and was married to George Monson.
