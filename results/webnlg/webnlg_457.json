Each triple should be represented as a distinct sentence or, where natural, closely related facts can be combined. The structuring should use multiple <snt> tags, each representing a single or closely related fact(s). To address this, I will reassign the task to the 'text structuring' worker, explicitly instructing them to use separate <snt> tags for each fact or for naturally combinable facts, as per the feedback. \nInstruction:\n- Structure the ordered content into a <paragraph> with multiple <snt> tags.\n- Each <snt> should represent a single fact or, if natural, combine closely related facts (e.g., both record labels in one sentence if it reads fluently).\n- Do not group unrelated facts into a single <snt>.\n- Ensure all data points are included, with no omissions or additions.\n- Prepare the output for the surface realization stage by making sure each <snt> is a clear, distinct sentence unit. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Mermaid_(Train_song) | genre | Pop_rock', 'Mermaid_(Train_song) | recordLabel | Columbia_Records', 'Mermaid_(Train_song) | runtime | 3.16', 'Mermaid_(Train_song) | recordLabel | Sony_Music_Entertainment']\n- Ordered Content: ['Mermaid_(Train_song) | genre | Pop_rock', 'Mermaid_(Train_song) | recordLabel | Columbia_Records', 'Mermaid_(Train_song) | recordLabel | Sony_Music_Entertainment', 'Mermaid_(Train_song) | runtime | 3.16']\n- Previous Output: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Mermaid_(Train_song) | genre | Pop_rock\n    Mermaid_(Train_song) | recordLabel | Columbia_Records\n    Mermaid_(Train_song) | recordLabel | Sony_Music_Entertainment\n    Mermaid_(Train_song) | runtime | 3.16\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: Grouping all four triples into a single <snt> (sentence) tag is not ideal, as each triple represents a distinct fact that would typically be expressed in separate or clearly delineated sentences.
