The structured output is a well-formed sentence-level unit that accurately represents the original data without omitting or adding information. The next step in the pipeline is Surface Realization, where the structured content will be transformed into a fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding sentence. I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the structured output, and clear instructions to ensure the final text is fluent and readable. \nInstruction:\n- Transform the structured content into a fluent, natural English sentence.\n- Replace underscores with spaces where appropriate (e.g., \"Petah_Tikva\" \u2192 \"Petah Tikva\").\n- Ensure the sentence is grammatically correct and easy to read.\n- Do not add any information not present in the original data.\n- Output only the final, fluent sentence. \n\nWorker Input: Original Data: ['Petah_Tikva | country | Israel']\nStructured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>Petah_Tikva is located in Israel.</snt>\n</paragraph>\nGuardrail Feedback: The structured content is correct and ready for surface realization.\nTask: Convert the structured sentence-level content into a fluent, natural-sounding, and grammatically correct sentence.

The <snt> tag should contain a structured sentence-level representation of the triple, not the triple itself. For example, it should be something like: <snt>Petah Tikva is a city in Israel.</snt> (without surface realization, but with clear grouping). Please group the triple into a sentence-level unit, not just restate the triple.\nNo prior surface realization results.\nTask: Structure the ordered content into a clear, organized sentence-level unit suitable for natural language generation. Ensure that all information from the triple is included and that no additional information is introduced. \nAdditional Instruction: - Group the triple into a single, well-structured sentence-level unit within the <snt> tag.\n- Do not simply restate the triple; instead, organize the information as it would appear in a natural sentence (e.g., \"Petah Tikva is a city in Israel.\").\n- Do not omit any data fields or add any information not present in the original triple.\n- Prepare the structured text for the next stage (Surface Realization).\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>Petah_Tikva is located in Israel.</snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\nOriginal Data: ['Petah_Tikva | country | Israel']\nStructured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>Petah_Tikva is located in Israel.</snt>\n</paragraph>\nGuardrail Feedback: The structured content is correct and ready for surface realization.\nTask: Convert the structured sentence-level content into a fluent, natural-sounding, and grammatically correct sentence.
