Ensure that all data points are included and that the structure supports a natural narrative flow. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured text outline or paragraph.\n- Group related information together (e.g., mention both actors starring in \"Super Capers\" in the same sentence or section).\n- Clearly indicate where each data point will be realized in the final text.\n- Do not omit any information or add new content.\n- Prepare the structure so that it is ready for fluent surface realization in the next stage.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | starring | Tom_Sizemore\n    Super_Capers | starring | Adam_West\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Tom_Sizemore | activeYearsStartYear | 1989-01-01\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Super_Capers | starring | Tom_Sizemore', 'Tom_Sizemore | activeYearsStartYear | 1989-01-01', 'Super_Capers | starring | Adam_West']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | starring | Tom_Sizemore\n    Super_Capers | starring | Adam_West\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Tom_Sizemore | activeYearsStartYear | 1989-01-01\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Realize the structured content as fluent, natural, and grammatically correct text.
