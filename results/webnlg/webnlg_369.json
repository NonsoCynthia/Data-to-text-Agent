The worker is expected to generate a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph that accurately reflects all the provided data points without adding or omitting information. \nInstruction:\n- Transform the structured text into a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph.\n- Ensure all data points (artist, genre, producer, runtime) are clearly and accurately represented in the final text.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new details.\n- The final text should be natural and readable, suitable for a general audience.\n- Avoid awkward phrasing or repetition. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Turn_Me_On_(album) | runtime | 35.1', 'Turn_Me_On_(album) | artist | The_Honeymoon_Killers_(American_band)', 'Turn_Me_On_(album) | genre | Punk_blues', 'Turn_Me_On_(album) | producer | The_Honeymoon_Killers_(American_band)']\n- Ordered Content: ['Turn_Me_On_(album) | artist | The_Honeymoon_Killers_(American_band)', 'Turn_Me_On_(album) | genre | Punk_blues', 'Turn_Me_On_(album) | producer | The_Honeymoon_Killers_(American_band)', 'Turn_Me_On_(album) | runtime | 35.1']\n- Structured Text: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Turn_Me_On_(album) | artist | The_Honeymoon_Killers_(American_band)\n    Turn_Me_On_(album) | genre | Punk_blues\n    Turn_Me_On_(album) | producer | The_Honeymoon_Killers_(American_band)\n    Turn_Me_On_(album) | runtime | 35.1\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (text structuring stage)\n- No prior surface realization attempts.', instruction='- Transform the structured text into a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph.\n- Ensure all data points (artist, genre, producer, runtime) are clearly and accurately represented in the final text.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new details.\n- The final text should be natural and readable, suitable for a general audience.\n- Avoid awkward phrasing or repetition. \n\nWorker Output: The album \"Turn Me On\" is by The Honeymoon Killers, an American band.
