Ensure all data points are included and clearly presented. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured text format (e.g., a paragraph or bullet list) that presents all the information about Bedford Aerodrome.\n- Do not omit any data or add any information not present in the input.\n- Make sure the structure is clear and will support fluent, natural language realization in the next stage.\n- Output the structured content, ready for surface realization.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 83.2104\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | runwayName | \"08/26\"\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | runwaySurfaceType | Concrete\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Bedford_Aerodrome | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 83.2104', 'Bedford_Aerodrome | runwayName | \"08/26\"', 'Bedford_Aerodrome | runwaySurfaceType | Concrete']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 83.2104\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | runwayName | \"08/26\"\n    Bedford_Aerodrome | runwaySurfaceType | Concrete\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback requiring changes.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding paragraph. Ensure that all information from the original data is included and clearly expressed. Do not add any information not present in the input. \nAdditional Instruction: - Transform the structured content into a coherent and fluent paragraph about Bedford Aerodrome.\n- Clearly mention the elevation above sea level, the runway name, and the runway surface type.\n- Do not omit any data or add extra information.\n- Ensure the text is natural, readable, and free from grammatical errors.\n- Output only the final, fluent text.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nBedford Aerodrome is situated at an elevation of 83.2104 meters above sea level.
