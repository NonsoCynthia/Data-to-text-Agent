To address this, I need to reassign the task to the 'text structuring' worker, explicitly instructing them to group only closely related facts (ideally about the same subject) within each sentence and to strictly follow the order of the content as provided. Each sentence should focus on a single subject or event, and the order of facts must match the ordered content list. This will ensure clarity, coherence, and alignment with the user's requirements and the guardrail's feedback. \nInstruction:\n- Structure the ordered content into a clear and organized textual format, such as a paragraph or a list.\n- Each sentence (<snt>) should group only closely related facts, ideally about the same subject or event.\n- Do not combine unrelated facts within the same sentence.\n- Strictly follow the order of the facts as provided in the ordered content list.\n- Ensure that each data point is represented and that the relationships between entities (e.g., Bananaman, BBC, Broadcasting House, Bill Oddie) are clear.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new details.\n- Prepare the structured text so it is ready for the surface realization stage, where it will be converted into fluent, natural language. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: \n  1.

The first <snt> combines facts about Bananaman and BBC that are not directly related (Bananaman's broadcaster and BBC's location), while the second <snt> combines unrelated facts about Bananaman (last aired date and starring actor).
