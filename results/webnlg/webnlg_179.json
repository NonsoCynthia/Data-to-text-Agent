Ensure all information is included and grouped appropriately for readability. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered data to create a structured text outline or paragraph.\n- Group related information (director and producer) if possible, as they refer to the same person.\n- Present the runtime information clearly.\n- Do not omit any data or add any information not present in the input.\n- Ensure the structure is logical and will support a fluent, natural-sounding final text.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | director | Sarah_Teale\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Sarah_Teale\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | runtime | 83.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Sarah_Teale', 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | director | Sarah_Teale', 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | runtime | 83.0']\n- Structured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | director | Sarah_Teale\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Sarah_Teale\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | runtime | 83.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: Previous stage output is CORRECT.\n- Task: Transform the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding paragraph. Ensure all information from the original data is included, with no omissions or additions. Clearly state that Sarah Teale is both the director and producer, and mention the runtime of 83 minutes. \nAdditional Instruction: - Write a single, coherent paragraph that includes all the information: the film's title, the fact that Sarah Teale is both the director and producer, and the runtime of 83 minutes.\n- Do not add any information not present in the input.\n- Ensure the text is fluent, clear, and free from grammatical errors.\n- Avoid repetition by grouping the director and producer roles for Sarah Teale.\n- The final output should be ready for presentation/publication.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nDeath on a Factory Farm is a film directed and produced by Sarah Teale, with a runtime of 83 minutes.\n-- OUTPUT END --\nFinalizer Agent: Carefully review the output provided above by the surface realization agent. Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
