I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the ordered facts, the structured paragraph, and clear instructions to ensure the final output is fluent, coherent, and does not omit or hallucinate any information. \nInstruction:\n- Convert the structured content into a fluent, natural-sounding English sentence or short paragraph.\n- Clearly state the film title, its director (Cyril Frankel), and both starring actors (John Mills and Cecil Parker).\n- Do not omit any information or introduce new facts.\n- Ensure the output is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read.\n- The final text should be suitable for direct presentation to a user. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: [\"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | John_Mills\", \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\", \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\"]\n- Ordered Facts: [\"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\", \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | John_Mills\", \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\"]\n- Structured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | director | Cyril_Frankel\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | John_Mills\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback requiring correction.', instruction='- Convert the structured content into a fluent, natural-sounding English sentence or short paragraph.\n- Clearly state the film title, its director (Cyril Frankel), and both starring actors (John Mills and Cecil Parker).\n- Do not omit any information or introduce new facts.\n- Ensure the output is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read.\n- The final text should be suitable for direct presentation to a user. \n\nWorker Output: The 1956 film \"It's Great to Be Young\" was directed by Cyril Frankel and stars John Mills and Cecil Parker.\n\nKeep your reply concise, avoid repetition, and use the following format:\nFEEDBACK:\n",
