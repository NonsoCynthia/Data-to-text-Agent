Ensure the structure supports a natural and coherent narrative flow. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered triples to create a structured text outline (preferably a paragraph structure) that introduces Trane, states its industry, and then presents its revenue and operating income.\n- Ensure all data points are included and clearly represented.\n- Do not add, omit, or alter any information from the input.\n- Output the structured text in a way that will make it easy for the next stage to generate fluent, natural language.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Trane | industry | Building_materials\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Trane | revenue | 10264000000\n    Trane | operatingIncome | 875400000\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Trane | operatingIncome | 875400000', 'Trane | industry | Building_materials', 'Trane | revenue | 10264000000']\n- Structured Text: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Trane | industry | Building_materials\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Trane | revenue | 10264000000\n    Trane | operatingIncome | 875400000\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Transform the structured text into a fluent, natural, and grammatically correct paragraph that includes all the information from the data.\n- Requirements: Do not omit any data or add any information not present in the input.
