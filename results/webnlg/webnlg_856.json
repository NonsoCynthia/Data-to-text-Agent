Ensure all facts are included and grouped appropriately (e.g., birthplaces together, missions together). \nAdditional Instruction: - Structure the ordered facts into a coherent textual outline or template, such as a paragraph or bullet points.\n- Group related information (birthplaces, missions) together in the structure.\n- Do not omit any facts or add new information.\n- Make the structure clear and easy to follow for the next stage (surface realization).\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Nie_Haisheng | birthPlace | Zaoyang\n    Nie_Haisheng | birthPlace | Hubei\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Nie_Haisheng | mission | Shenzhou_6\n    Nie_Haisheng | mission | Shenzhou_10\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Nie_Haisheng | birthPlace | Zaoyang', 'Nie_Haisheng | birthPlace | Hubei', 'Nie_Haisheng | mission | Shenzhou_10', 'Nie_Haisheng | mission | Shenzhou_6']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Nie_Haisheng | birthPlace | Zaoyang\n    Nie_Haisheng | birthPlace | Hubei\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Nie_Haisheng | mission | Shenzhou_6\n    Nie_Haisheng | mission | Shenzhou_10\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior surface realization results or guardrail feedback.\n- Task: Transform the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and readable paragraph. Ensure all facts are included, no information is omitted or invented, and the text is natural and coherent. \nAdditional Instruction: - Write a fluent paragraph that includes all the information: Nie Haisheng's birthplaces (Zaoyang and Hubei) and his missions (Shenzhou 6 and Shenzhou 10).\n- Do not omit any facts or add extra information.\n- Ensure the text is clear, natural, and easy to read.\n- Avoid listing the raw data; instead, express the facts in natural language.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nNie Haisheng was born in Zaoyang, Hubei.
