I will include the original data, the structured content, the guardrail feedback, and clear expectations for the output. \nInstruction:\n- Transform the structured content into fluent, readable sentences.\n- Explicitly state that Lady Anne Monson was born in Darlington and in the Kingdom of England, treating them as separate birthplaces.\n- Do not imply that Darlington is within the Kingdom of England or that there is any relationship between the two, unless it is explicitly stated in the data.\n- Do not add any information not present in the data, and do not omit any facts.\n- Ensure the text is natural, clear, and grammatically correct."
