The original data only provides the value \"22591.38\" without specifying a unit (e.g., square kilometers or square miles). Since the unit is not present in the data, we must not invent or assume it, but we must also not omit any information. The best approach is to explicitly state that the unit is unspecified or unknown, ensuring we do not hallucinate or omit information. I will reassign the task to the surface realization worker, instructing them to address the guardrail feedback by including a note about the missing unit. \nInstruction:\n- Convert the structured content into a fluent, natural English sentence.\n- Ensure all information from the original data is included and clearly represented.\n- Do not add, omit, or alter any information.\n- Since the unit of measurement for the area is not specified in the data, explicitly state that the unit is unspecified or unknown in your output.\n- The final output should be a single, grammatically correct sentence suitable for presentation to a user, and should address the guardrail feedback regarding the missing unit. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['New_Jersey | areaTotal | 22591.38']\n- Structured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    New_Jersey | areaTotal | 22591.38\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: \n  - [Fluency & Grammar]: The unit of measurement for the area is missing, making the sentence incomplete and unclear.\n  - [Faithfulness & Adequacy]: The unit of measurement for the area (e.g., square kilometers or square miles) is missing, which omits essential information from the original data.\n  - [Coherence & Naturalness]: The output omits the unit of measurement for the area, making the information incomplete and less clear.\n  - OVERALL: Rerun surface realization with feedback\n- Task: Transform the structured content into a fluent, natural-sounding sentence that accurately conveys the information from the original data, while addressing the guardrail feedback.\n- Requirements: Do not omit any information or add any extra details.
