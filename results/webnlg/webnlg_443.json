Do not omit any information or add any new facts. \nAdditional Instruction: - Take the two ordered facts about \"Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes\".\n- Organize them into a coherent textual structure, such as a single paragraph or a bullet list, making sure all information is included and clearly presented.\n- Do not generate full natural language sentences yet; focus on grouping and structuring the information for the next stage.\n- Ensure the structure is logical and will support fluent text realization in the following step.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | producer | The_Velvet_Underground\n    Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | runtime | 230.05\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | producer | The_Velvet_Underground', 'Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | runtime | 230.05']\n- Structured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | producer | The_Velvet_Underground\n    Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes | runtime | 230.05\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback requiring revision.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and readable paragraph. Ensure that all information from the original data is included and presented clearly. Do not add any information that is not present in the data. \nAdditional Instruction: - Write a natural, fluent paragraph that includes both the producer and runtime information for \"Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes\".\n- Ensure the text is clear, coherent, and does not omit or invent any facts.\n- Do not add any extra information or make assumptions beyond the provided data.\n- The final output should be suitable for direct presentation to a user.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nBootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes was produced by The Velvet Underground and has a runtime of 230.05 minutes.\n-- OUTPUT END --\nFinalizer Agent: Carefully review the output provided above by the surface realization agent. Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness.
