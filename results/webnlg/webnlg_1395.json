The triple should be expressed as a sentence (e.g., \"Re\u015fadiye is located in Turkey.\") within the <snt> tag. The current grouping is not suitable for the surface realization stage.\n- Task: Revise the structured content so that the relationship between 'Re\u015fadiye' and 'Turkey' is expressed as a clear, natural language sentence within the <snt> tag, suitable for the next stage. \nAdditional Instruction: - Convert the triple \"Re\u015fadiye | country | Turkey\" into a well-structured sentence that clearly states the relationship (e.g., \"Re\u015fadiye is located in Turkey.\") and place it within the <snt> tag inside a <paragraph> tag.\n- Do not repeat the triple in its raw form.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new details.\n- Ensure the output is ready for the surface realization stage, with all information from the triple present and no additional or missing details.\n- Follow the feedback: the output must be a natural language sentence, not a raw triple.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Re\u015fadiye is located in Turkey.\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Re\u015fadiye | country | Turkey']\n- Ordered Content: ['Re\u015fadiye | country | Turkey']\n- Structured Content: \n  <paragraph>\n    <snt>\n      Re\u015fadiye is located in Turkey.\n    </snt>\n  </paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (previous stage)\n- Task: Produce the final, fluent, and grammatically correct text based on the structured content above.
