The worker's task is to generate a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph that covers all the facts without omission or hallucination. \nInstruction:\n- Convert the structured text into a natural, fluent paragraph.\n- Ensure all facts are included and clearly expressed.\n- Do not add or omit any information.\n- The final text should be grammatically correct and easy to read.\n- Output only the final paragraph, ready for user delivery. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Super_Capers | distributor | Lionsgate', 'Lionsgate | keyPerson | Jon_Feltheimer', 'Lionsgate | keyPerson | Michael_R._Burns', 'Super_Capers | starring | Michael_Rooker', 'Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)']\n- Ordered Facts: ['Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)', 'Super_Capers | starring | Michael_Rooker', 'Super_Capers | distributor | Lionsgate', 'Lionsgate | keyPerson | Jon_Feltheimer', 'Lionsgate | keyPerson | Michael_R._Burns']\n- Structured Text:\n  <paragraph>\n    <snt>\n      Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)\n      Super_Capers | starring | Michael_Rooker\n      Super_Capers | distributor | Lionsgate\n    </snt>\n    <snt>\n      Lionsgate | keyPerson | Jon_Feltheimer\n      Lionsgate | keyPerson | Michael_R._Burns\n    </snt>\n  </paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (previous stage)\n- Task: Generate a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph that covers all the facts in the structured text.
