I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the ordered data, the structured text, and clear instructions to generate a fluent, coherent, and accurate natural language text that covers all the information without omission or hallucination. \nInstruction:\n- Write a fluent paragraph that includes all the information from the structured text.\n- Clearly state Nurhan Atasoy's birth date, citizenship, and residence.\n- Clearly state both time zones associated with Istanbul.\n- Do not add or omit any information.\n- Ensure the text is coherent, natural, and free of grammatical errors. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Nurhan_Atasoy | citizenship | Turkey', 'Istanbul | timeZone | Eastern_European_Summer_Time', 'Istanbul | timeZone | Eastern_European_Time', 'Nurhan_Atasoy | birthDate | 1934-01-01', 'Nurhan_Atasoy | residence | Istanbul']\n- Ordered Data: ['Nurhan_Atasoy | birthDate | 1934-01-01', 'Nurhan_Atasoy | citizenship | Turkey', 'Nurhan_Atasoy | residence | Istanbul', 'Istanbul | timeZone | Eastern_European_Time', 'Istanbul | timeZone | Eastern_European_Summer_Time']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Nurhan_Atasoy | birthDate | 1934-01-01\n    Nurhan_Atasoy | citizenship | Turkey\n    Nurhan_Atasoy | residence | Istanbul\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Istanbul | timeZone | Eastern_European_Time\n    Istanbul | timeZone | Eastern_European_Summer_Time\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior surface realization results or guardrail feedback.\n- Task: Transform the structured text into a fluent, natural, and grammatically correct paragraph.
