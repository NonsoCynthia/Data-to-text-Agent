Do not add any information not present in the data. \nAdditional Instruction: - Write a fluent paragraph that includes all the information: the manufacturer (Pontiac), the production start year (1997), and the production end year (1997) of the Pontiac Rageous.\n- Do not omit any data or add extra information.\n- Ensure the text is clear, coherent, and free of grammatical errors.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nThe Pontiac Rageous was manufactured by Pontiac and was produced only in the year 1997.\n-- OUTPUT END --\nFinalizer Agent: Carefully review the output provided above by the surface realization agent. Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
