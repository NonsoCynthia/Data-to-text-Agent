Ensure all data points are included and relationships between entities are explicit. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured text outline, such as a paragraph or bullet points.\n- Clearly connect the facts about the University of Burgundy and its relationship to Dijon.\n- Ensure the elevation fact about Dijon is included and its relevance is clear.\n- Do not omit any data or introduce new information.\n- Prepare the structure so it is ready for fluent surface realization in the next stage.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | numberOfStudents | 27400\n    University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Dijon | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 245.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['University_of_Burgundy | numberOfStudents | 27400', 'University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon', 'Dijon | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 245.0']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | numberOfStudents | 27400\n    University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Dijon | elevationAboveTheSeaLevel | 245.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into fluent, grammatically correct, and coherent text.
