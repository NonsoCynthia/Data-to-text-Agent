The worker's task is to generate fluent, coherent, and natural text that covers all the information without omissions or hallucinations. \nInstruction:\n- Transform the structured content into fluent, natural, and coherent text.\n- Ensure that all information from the structured content is included, with no omissions or additions.\n- Present the facts in a way that is easy to read and understand, using appropriate sentence structure and transitions.\n- Do not invent or hallucinate any information not present in the data.\n- The final text should be ready for presentation/publication. \n\nWorker Input: Original Data: \n['Mexico | currency | Mexican_peso', \n 'Mexico | demonym | Mexicans', \n 'Bionico | course | Dessert', \n 'Bionico | region | Guadalajara', \n 'Bionico | ingredient | Raisin', \n 'Dessert | dishVariation | Cookie', \n 'Bionico | country | Mexico']\n\nOrdered Content: \n['Mexico | currency | Mexican_peso', 'Mexico | demonym | Mexicans', 'Bionico | country | Mexico', 'Bionico | region | Guadalajara', 'Bionico | course | Dessert', 'Bionico | ingredient | Raisin', 'Dessert | dishVariation | Cookie']\n\nStructured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Mexico | currency | Mexican_peso\n    Mexico | demonym | Mexicans\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Bionico | country | Mexico\n    Bionico | region | Guadalajara\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Bionico | course | Dessert\n    Bionico | ingredient | Raisin\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Dessert | dishVariation | Cookie\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n\nGuardrail Feedback: CORRECT', instruction='- Transform the structured content into fluent, natural, and coherent text.\n- Ensure that all information from the structured content is included, with no omissions or additions.\n- Present the facts in a way that is easy to read and understand, using appropriate sentence structure and transitions.\n- Do not invent or hallucinate any information not present in the data.\n- The final text should be ready for presentation/publication. \n\nWorker Output: Mexico uses the Mexican peso as its currency, and its people are known as Mexicans.
