I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the ordered data, the structured text, and clear instructions to generate a fluent, coherent, and accurate paragraph that covers all the provided information without adding or omitting any details. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['1147_Stavropolis | apoapsis | 418476000000.0', '1147_Stavropolis | orbitalPeriod | 1249.6', '1147_Stavropolis | discoverer | Grigory_Neujmin', '1147_Stavropolis | discovered | 1929-06-11']\n- Ordered Data: ['1147_Stavropolis | discoverer | Grigory_Neujmin', '1147_Stavropolis | discovered | 1929-06-11', '1147_Stavropolis | orbitalPeriod | 1249.6', '1147_Stavropolis | apoapsis | 418476000000.0']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    1147_Stavropolis | discoverer | Grigory_Neujmin\n    1147_Stavropolis | discovered | 1929-06-11\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    1147_Stavropolis | orbitalPeriod | 1249.6\n    1147_Stavropolis | apoapsis | 418476000000.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.', instruction='- Write a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph that includes all the information from the structured text.\n- Ensure that all data fields (discoverer, discovery date, orbital period, and apoapsis) are mentioned clearly and accurately.\n- Do not add any information not present in the input or omit any provided data.\n- The final text should be natural and easy to read, suitable for a general audience. \n\nWorker Output: 1147 Stavropolis was discovered by Grigory Neujmin on June 11, 1929. This celestial object has an orbital period of 1249.6 and an apoapsis of 418,476,000,000.0.\n\nKeep your reply concise, avoid repetition, and use the following format:\nFEEDBACK:\n",
