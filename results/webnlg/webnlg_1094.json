Ensure all information is included and nothing is omitted or added. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered data to create a structured text outline or paragraph skeleton about the ALCO RS-3.\n- Present the builder first, followed by the build date, and then the cylinder count.\n- Do not add any information or omit any details from the ordered data.\n- The output should be a structured text (e.g., a paragraph outline or bullet points) that clearly presents all the facts in a logical order, ready for surface realization.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    ALCO_RS-3 | builder | American_Locomotive_Company\n    ALCO_RS-3 | buildDate | \"May 1950 - August 1956\"\n    ALCO_RS-3 | cylinderCount | 12\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['ALCO_RS-3 | buildDate | \"May 1950 - August 1956\"', 'ALCO_RS-3 | builder | American_Locomotive_Company', 'ALCO_RS-3 | cylinderCount | 12']\n- Ordered Data: ['ALCO_RS-3 | builder | American_Locomotive_Company', 'ALCO_RS-3 | buildDate | \"May 1950 - August 1956\"', 'ALCO_RS-3 | cylinderCount | 12']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    ALCO_RS-3 | builder | American_Locomotive_Company\n    ALCO_RS-3 | buildDate | \"May 1950 - August 1956\"\n    ALCO_RS-3 | cylinderCount | 12\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage. \nAdditional Instruction: - Transform the structured text into a fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding paragraph.\n- Ensure all information is included: the builder (American Locomotive Company), the build date (\"May 1950 - August 1956\"), and the cylinder count (12).\n- Do not add any information or omit any details.\n- The output should be a single, coherent paragraph suitable for a general audience, clearly presenting all facts about the ALCO RS-3.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nThe ALCO RS-3 was built by the American Locomotive Company between May 1950 and August 1956.
