Output the structured content, clearly indicating the organization (e.g., paragraph structure, bullet points, etc.), ready for the surface realization stage.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | almaMater | Leningrad_State_University\n    Olga_Bondareva | deathPlace | Saint_Petersburg\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Saint_Petersburg | foundingDate | 1703-05-27\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Olga_Bondareva | almaMater | Leningrad_State_University', 'Saint_Petersburg | foundingDate | 1703-05-27', 'Olga_Bondareva | deathPlace | Saint_Petersburg']\n- Ordered Content: ['Olga_Bondareva | almaMater | Leningrad_State_University', 'Olga_Bondareva | deathPlace | Saint_Petersburg', 'Saint_Petersburg | foundingDate | 1703-05-27']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Olga_Bondareva | almaMater | Leningrad_State_University\n    Olga_Bondareva | deathPlace | Saint_Petersburg\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Saint_Petersburg | foundingDate | 1703-05-27\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (text structuring is logical and complete)\n- No prior surface realization results. \nAdditional Instruction: 1. Convert the structured content into fluent, natural language text that is clear, coherent, and readable.\n2. Ensure that all information from the structured content is included and accurately represented.\n3. Do not add or omit any information (no hallucination or omission).\n4. Produce a final paragraph that reads naturally and is suitable for a general audience.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nOlga Bondareva attended Leningrad State University and passed away in Saint Petersburg.

Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
