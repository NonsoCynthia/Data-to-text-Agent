I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the ordered content, the structured content, and clear instructions to ensure all information is included without hallucination. \nInstruction:\n- Generate fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct text based on the structured content provided.\n- Ensure all facts from the original data are included and accurately represented.\n- Do not add any information not present in the data (no hallucination).\n- Present the information in a natural and readable way, grouping related facts as indicated in the structure.\n- Double-check that no data field is omitted or repeated.\n- The final output should be a well-formed paragraph or set of paragraphs suitable for a general audience. \n\nWorker Input: Original Data: \n['Hypermarcas | location | S\u00e3o_Paulo', \n 'Brazil | leaderTitle | \"President of the Supreme Federal Court\"', \n 'Hypermarcas | location | Brazil', \n 'Hypermarcas | product | Drugs', \n 'Hypermarcas | product | Healthcare']\n\nOrdered Content: \n['Hypermarcas | location | S\u00e3o_Paulo', 'Hypermarcas | location | Brazil', 'Hypermarcas | product | Drugs', 'Hypermarcas | product | Healthcare', 'Brazil | leaderTitle | \"President of the Supreme Federal Court\"']\n\nStructured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Hypermarcas | location | S\u00e3o_Paulo\n    Hypermarcas | location | Brazil\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Hypermarcas | product | Drugs\n    Hypermarcas | product | Healthcare\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Brazil | leaderTitle | \"President of the Supreme Federal Court\"\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n\nNo prior guardrail feedback for this stage.', instruction='- Generate fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct text based on the structured content provided.\n- Ensure all facts from the original data are included and accurately represented.\n- Do not add any information not present in the data (no hallucination).\n- Present the information in a natural and readable way, grouping related facts as indicated in the structure.\n- Double-check that no data field is omitted or repeated.\n- The final output should be a well-formed paragraph or set of paragraphs suitable for a general audience. \n\nWorker Output: Hypermarcas is located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and is involved in the production of drugs and healthcare products.
