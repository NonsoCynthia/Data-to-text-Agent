Ensure that all information from the ordered triples is included and that no new information is introduced. \nAdditional Instruction: - Review the ordered data triples about 1147_Stavropolis.\n- Structure the information into a single coherent paragraph or a well-organized list, making sure each data point is clearly presented.\n- Do not omit any information or add any new facts.\n- Prepare the structured text so it is ready for the surface realization stage, ensuring clarity and logical flow.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    1147_Stavropolis | periapsis | 260855000000.0\n    1147_Stavropolis | epoch | 31 July 2016 (JD2457600.5)\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['1147_Stavropolis | periapsis | 260855000000.0', '1147_Stavropolis | epoch | 31 July 2016 (JD2457600.5)']\n- Structured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    1147_Stavropolis | periapsis | 260855000000.0\n    1147_Stavropolis | epoch | 31 July 2016 (JD2457600.5)\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior surface realization attempts or guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, grammatically correct, and readable paragraph. Ensure that all information from the original data is included and clearly expressed in natural language. Do not add any new information or omit any details. \nAdditional Instruction: - Transform the structured content into a well-formed English sentence or short paragraph.\n- Clearly state the periapsis and epoch values for 1147_Stavropolis.\n- Ensure the text is fluent, coherent, and free of grammatical errors.\n- Do not introduce any new facts or omit any information from the original data.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nThe asteroid 1147 Stavropolis has a periapsis of 260,855,000,000.0 and its epoch is 31 July 2016 (JD2457600.5).\n-- OUTPUT END --\nFinalizer Agent: Carefully review the output provided above by the surface realization agent. Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness.
