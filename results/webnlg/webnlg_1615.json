Ensure all facts are included and clearly connected, and do not add or omit any information. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered facts to create a structured text outline or paragraph that connects the entities and their relationships clearly.\n- Ensure the structure is easy to follow and will allow for natural, fluent text generation in the next stage.\n- Do not invent or omit any information.\n- Output the structured text (as a paragraph or list), ready for surface realization.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Ciudad_Ayala | isPartOf | Morelos\n    Morelos | leader | Adri\u00e1n_Rivera_P\u00e9rez\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Ciudad_Ayala | leaderTitle | \"City Manager\"\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['Morelos | leader | Adri\u00e1n_Rivera_P\u00e9rez', 'Ciudad_Ayala | leaderTitle | \"City Manager\"', 'Ciudad_Ayala | isPartOf | Morelos']\n- Structured Text:\n  <paragraph>\n    <snt>\n      Ciudad_Ayala | isPartOf | Morelos\n      Morelos | leader | Adri\u00e1n_Rivera_P\u00e9rez\n    </snt>\n    <snt>\n      Ciudad_Ayala | leaderTitle | \"City Manager\"\n    </snt>\n  </paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback indicating issues.\n- Task: Convert the structured text into a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph.
