Do not add any extra information or omit any details. \nAdditional Instruction: - Write a natural, fluent paragraph about the ALCO RS-3, beginning with its build date and then mentioning its length.\n- Ensure the text is clear, coherent, and includes both the build date (\"May 1950 - August 1956\") and the length (17068.8 millimetres).\n- Do not add or omit any information. Avoid awkward phrasing and ensure the result reads smoothly.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nThe ALCO RS-3 was built between May 1950 and August 1956.

Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
