The surface realization worker will be provided with the original data, the ordered content, the structured paragraph, and the guardrail feedback. The worker's task is to generate a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct text that accurately conveys all the information without omitting or hallucinating any details. \nInstruction:\n- Produce a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph that conveys all the information from the structured content.\n- Ensure that the text clearly states that \"Death on a Factory Farm\" was directed by Tom Simon, produced by Tom Simon and Sarah Teale, edited by Geof Bartz, and broadcast by HBO.\n- Do not omit any information or add any details not present in the data.\n- The output should be natural and ready for final delivery. \n\nWorker Input: Original Data: \n['Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | director | Tom_Simon', \n 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Tom_Simon', \n 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | broadcastedBy | HBO', \n 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | editor | Geof_Bartz', \n 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Sarah_Teale']\n\nOrdered Content: \n['Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | director | Tom_Simon', \n 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Tom_Simon', \n 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Sarah_Teale', \n 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | editor | Geof_Bartz', \n 'Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | broadcastedBy | HBO']\n\nText Structure:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | director | Tom_Simon\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Tom_Simon\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | producer | Sarah_Teale\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | editor | Geof_Bartz\n    Death_on_a_Factory_Farm | broadcastedBy | HBO\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n\nGuardrail Feedback: CORRECT', instruction='- Produce a fluent, coherent, and grammatically correct paragraph that conveys all the information from the structured content.\n- Ensure that the text clearly states that \"Death on a Factory Farm\" was directed by Tom Simon, produced by Tom Simon and Sarah Teale, edited by Geof Bartz, and broadcast by HBO.\n- Do not omit any information or add any details not present in the data.\n- The output should be natural and ready for final delivery. \n\nWorker Output: Death on a Factory Farm was directed by Tom Simon, who also served as one of the producers alongside Sarah Teale.
