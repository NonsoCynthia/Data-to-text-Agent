I will provide the original data, the ordered content, the structured content, and clear instructions to ensure the final output is fluent, coherent, and contextually accurate. \nInstruction:\n- Convert the structured content into a fluent, natural-sounding English sentence or short paragraph.\n- Clearly attribute each role (writer, music composer, starring actor) to the correct person.\n- Do not omit any information or add any details not present in the input.\n- Ensure the text is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read.\n- The final output should be suitable for presentation to a general audience. \n\nWorker Input: Original Data: \n[\"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | musicComposer | Louis_Levy\", \n \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\", \n \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | writer | Ted_Willis\"]\n\nOrdered Content: \n[\"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | writer | Ted_Willis\", \n \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | musicComposer | Louis_Levy\", \n \"It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\"]\n\nStructured Content: \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | writer | Ted_Willis\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | musicComposer | Louis_Levy\n    It's_Great_to_Be_Young_(1956_film) | starring | Cecil_Parker\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n\nNo prior guardrail feedback for this stage.', instruction='- Convert the structured content into a fluent, natural-sounding English sentence or short paragraph.\n- Clearly attribute each role (writer, music composer, starring actor) to the correct person.\n- Do not omit any information or add any details not present in the input.\n- Ensure the text is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to read.\n- The final output should be suitable for presentation to a general audience. \n\nWorker Output: The 1956 film \"It's Great to Be Young\" was written by Ted Willis, with music composed by Louis Levy, and stars Cecil Parker.\n\nKeep your reply concise, avoid repetition, and use the following format:\nFEEDBACK:\n",
