The grouping tags are well-formed, and no facts are omitted or added, but the content is not properly structured for the next stage. The triple should be expressed as a sentence (e.g., \"MotorSport Vision is located in Longfield.\"). \nAdditional Instruction: - Convert the ordered triple into a well-structured sentence or short paragraph using natural language.\n- Ensure that both entities ('MotorSport Vision' and 'Longfield') and the relation ('city') are clearly and accurately represented in the sentence.\n- Do not omit any information or add any details not present in the data.\n- Use grouping tags as appropriate, but the content inside <snt> must be a natural language sentence, not the raw triple.\n- Example: \"MotorSport Vision is located in Longfield.\"\n- Prepare the structured text for the next stage (Surface Realization).\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    MotorSport Vision is located in Longfield.\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['MotorSport_Vision | city | Longfield']\n- Ordered Content: ['MotorSport_Vision | city | Longfield']\n- Structured Text: \n  <paragraph>\n    <snt>\n      MotorSport Vision is located in Longfield.\n    </snt>\n  </paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (Text structuring output is accurate and complete.)\n- Previous Output: \n  <paragraph>\n    <snt>\n      MotorSport Vision is located in Longfield.\n    </snt>\n  </paragraph>\n- Expectation: Produce the final, fluent, and grammatically correct text based on the structured content above.
