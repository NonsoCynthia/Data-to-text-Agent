Ensure all information from the input is included: Nie Haisheng's birth date (1964-10-13), birth places (Zaoyang and Hubei), and missions (Shenzhou 6 and Shenzhou 10).\n3. Do not add any information not present in the input.\n4. Write in clear, grammatically correct English, combining related facts into coherent sentences.\n5.
