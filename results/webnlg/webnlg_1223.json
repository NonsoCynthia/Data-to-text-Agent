Ensure all data points are included and none are omitted or altered. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered content to create a structured textual outline or template (such as a paragraph skeleton or bullet points).\n- Ensure the structure supports a natural, informative, and coherent description of the University of Burgundy.\n- Do not omit any data or add any information not present in the input.\n- Clearly separate each data point in the structure, making it easy for the next stage to realize into fluent text.\n- Output the structured content in a format suitable for surface realization.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon\n    University_of_Burgundy | country | France\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | numberOfPostgraduateStudents | 9400\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon', 'University_of_Burgundy | numberOfPostgraduateStudents | 9400', 'University_of_Burgundy | country | France']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | city | Dijon\n    University_of_Burgundy | country | France\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    University_of_Burgundy | numberOfPostgraduateStudents | 9400\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior surface realization results or guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Transform the structured content into fluent, natural, and grammatically correct text. Ensure that all data points are included, accurately represented, and that the text is coherent and easy to read. Do not omit or add any information. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the structured content to generate a fluent paragraph about the University of Burgundy.\n- Clearly mention its location (city: Dijon, country: France) and the number of postgraduate students (9400).\n- Ensure the text is natural, informative, and free from grammatical errors.\n- Do not add any information not present in the input data.\n- Output only the final, fluent text.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nThe University of Burgundy is located in Dijon, France.

Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
