The structured content logically groups the facts and ensures that all information is represented without omission or repetition. The next step is to proceed to the surface realization stage, where the structured content will be transformed into fluent, natural language text. I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the structured content, and clear instructions to ensure the final output is coherent, fluent, and free from hallucinations. \nInstruction:\n- Convert the structured content into fluent, natural language text.\n- Ensure that all facts are included and accurately represented.\n- Do not add any information not present in the data.\n- The final text should be coherent, readable, and free from grammatical errors.\n- Avoid awkward phrasing and ensure smooth transitions between sentences.\n- Output a single, well-formed paragraph that covers all the provided facts. \n\nWorker Input: Original Data: \n['Abraham_A._Ribicoff | spouse | \"Ruth Ribicoff\"', \n 'Abraham_A._Ribicoff | inOfficeWhilePresident | John_F._Kennedy', \n 'Abraham_A._Ribicoff | nationality | American', \n 'Abraham_A._Ribicoff | successor | John_N._Dempsey', \n 'Abraham_A._Ribicoff | birthPlace | United_States']\n\nStructured Content (from text structuring): \n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Abraham_A._Ribicoff | birthPlace | United_States\n    Abraham_A._Ribicoff | nationality | American\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Abraham_A._Ribicoff | spouse | \"Ruth Ribicoff\"\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Abraham_A._Ribicoff | inOfficeWhilePresident | John_F._Kennedy\n    Abraham_A._Ribicoff | successor | John_N._Dempsey\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n\nNo prior guardrail feedback for this stage.', instruction='- Convert the structured content into fluent, natural language text.\n- Ensure that all facts are included and accurately represented.\n- Do not add any information not present in the data.\n- The final text should be coherent, readable, and free from grammatical errors.\n- Avoid awkward phrasing and ensure smooth transitions between sentences.\n- Output a single, well-formed paragraph that covers all the provided facts. \n\nWorker Output: Abraham A.
