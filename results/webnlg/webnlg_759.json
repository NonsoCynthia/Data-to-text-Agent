Ribicoff's birthplace, political party, and spouse, as well as the information about the United States' ethnic group.\n- Do not add any information not present in the data, and do not omit any facts.\n- Make the text coherent and readable, connecting the facts smoothly. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Abraham_A._Ribicoff | spouse | \"Ruth Ribicoff\"', 'Abraham_A._Ribicoff | party | Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Abraham_A._Ribicoff | birthPlace | United_States', 'United_States | ethnicGroup | African_Americans']\n- Ordered Data: ['Abraham_A._Ribicoff | birthPlace | United_States', 'Abraham_A._Ribicoff | party | Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Abraham_A._Ribicoff | spouse | \"Ruth Ribicoff\"', 'United_States | ethnicGroup | African_Americans']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Abraham_A._Ribicoff | birthPlace | United_States\n    Abraham_A._Ribicoff | party | Democratic_Party_(United_States)\n    Abraham_A._Ribicoff | spouse | \"Ruth Ribicoff\"\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    United_States | ethnicGroup | African_Americans\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.', instruction='- Transform the structured content into a fluent, natural-sounding paragraph.\n- Ensure all facts are included: Abraham A.
