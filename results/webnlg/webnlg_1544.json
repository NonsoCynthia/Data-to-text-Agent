I will provide the surface realization worker with the original data, the ordered facts, the structured text, and clear instructions to ensure all information is included without hallucination or omission. \nInstruction:\n- Convert the structured text into a fluent, natural, and grammatically correct paragraph about Brandon Carter.\n- Ensure all facts from the original data are included and clearly expressed.\n- Do not add any information not present in the data (no hallucination).\n- The final text should be coherent, readable, and suitable for a general audience. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Brandon_Carter | professionalField | General_relativity', 'Brandon_Carter | knownFor | Carter_constant', 'Brandon_Carter | knownFor | No-hair_theorem', 'Brandon_Carter | doctoralAdvisor | Dennis_William_Sciama', 'Brandon_Carter | birthPlace | England', 'Brandon_Carter | birthDate | 1942-01-01']\n- Ordered Facts: ['Brandon_Carter | birthDate | 1942-01-01', 'Brandon_Carter | birthPlace | England', 'Brandon_Carter | doctoralAdvisor | Dennis_William_Sciama', 'Brandon_Carter | professionalField | General_relativity', 'Brandon_Carter | knownFor | Carter_constant', 'Brandon_Carter | knownFor | No-hair_theorem']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Brandon_Carter | birthDate | 1942-01-01\n    Brandon_Carter | birthPlace | England\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Brandon_Carter | doctoralAdvisor | Dennis_William_Sciama\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Brandon_Carter | professionalField | General_relativity\n    Brandon_Carter | knownFor | Carter_constant\n    Brandon_Carter | knownFor | No-hair_theorem\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback requiring correction.', instruction='- Convert the structured text into a fluent, natural, and grammatically correct paragraph about Brandon Carter.\n- Ensure all facts from the original data are included and clearly expressed.\n- Do not add any information not present in the data (no hallucination).\n- The final text should be coherent, readable, and suitable for a general audience. \n\nWorker Output: Brandon Carter was born on January 1, 1942, in England.
