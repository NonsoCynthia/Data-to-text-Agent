Ensure that all information from the original data is included, that no extra information is added, and that the text is clear, coherent, and grammatically correct. \nAdditional Instruction: - Write a fluent paragraph that includes all the information: the film \"Death on a Factory Farm\" was directed by Tom Simon and Sarah Teale, and the music was composed by Jamie Lawrence.\n- Do not omit any details or add any information not present in the data.\n- Ensure the text is natural, clear, and free of grammatical errors.\n- Output only the final, fluent text.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nThe film \"Death on a Factory Farm\" was directed by Tom Simon and Sarah Teale, with music composed by Jamie Lawrence.\n-- OUTPUT END --\nFinalizer Agent: Carefully review the output provided above by the surface realization agent. Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness.
