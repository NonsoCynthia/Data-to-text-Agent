Ensure all data points are included and clearly related. \nAdditional Instruction: - Use the ordered data to create a structured text outline or draft (such as a paragraph or bullet points).\n- Present the information in a way that makes logical sense and is easy for a reader to follow.\n- Do not omit any data or add any information not present in the input.\n- Ensure each data point is clearly represented and the relationships between entities are maintained.\n- Output the structured text, ready for surface realization.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bananaman | creator | Steve_Bright\n    Bananaman | firstAired | \"1983-10-03\"\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Bananaman | broadcastedBy | BBC\n    BBC | city | Broadcasting_House\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n-- OUTPUT END --\n##=== END:TEXT STRUCTURING_1 ===##\n\n##=== BEGIN:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n-- AGENT TYPE: surface realization\n-- AGENT NAME: surface realization\n-- INPUT START --\n- Original Data: ['BBC | city | Broadcasting_House', 'Bananaman | creator | Steve_Bright', 'Bananaman | broadcastedBy | BBC', 'Bananaman | firstAired | \"1983-10-03\"']\n- Ordered Data: ['Bananaman | creator | Steve_Bright', 'Bananaman | firstAired | \"1983-10-03\"', 'Bananaman | broadcastedBy | BBC', 'BBC | city | Broadcasting_House']\n- Structured Text:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Bananaman | creator | Steve_Bright\n    Bananaman | firstAired | \"1983-10-03\"\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Bananaman | broadcastedBy | BBC\n    BBC | city | Broadcasting_House\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- Guardrail Feedback: CORRECT (all data points included, structure logical)\n- No prior surface realization attempts. \nAdditional Instruction: - Transform the structured text into a fluent, natural, and coherent paragraph.\n- Ensure all information from the original data is included and accurately represented.\n- Do not add any information not present in the input (no hallucination).\n- Maintain clarity and readability, ensuring the relationships between entities are clear.\n- Output a single, well-formed paragraph suitable for a general audience.\n-- INPUT END --\n-- OUTPUT START --\nBananaman was created by Steve Bright and first aired on October 3, 1983.

Edit and refine the text as a human would, ensuring maximum fluency, semantic adequacy, coherence, and naturalness. Your task is to produce the best possible final text, correcting any errors or awkwardness if present.\n##=== END:SURFACE REALIZATION_2 ===##\n\n*** Output Format ***\nFinal Answer: \n",
