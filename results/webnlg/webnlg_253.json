Both triples are placed within a single <snt> tag, which implies they should be expressed as a single sentence, but they are not necessarily closely related enough for this. Each triple should typically correspond to its own <snt> unless they are tightly connected. Additionally, the triples are presented in raw form rather than as structured content.
