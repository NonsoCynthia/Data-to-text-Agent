The content is already organized into sentence and paragraph units according to the provided facts. Now I need to perform the surface realization step, turning each <snt> block into a fluent sentence and merging them into a coherent, professionally written paragraph, ensuring that no fact is omitted or altered.\n\n                Worker Input: Please transform the following structured content into fluent, natural language text.
