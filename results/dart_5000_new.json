I need to transform each <snt> group into a fluent sentence, combining all of them into a single cohesive paragraph.\n\n                Worker Input: Please transform the following structured data\u2014grouped into sentence (<snt>) and paragraph (<paragraph>) units\u2014into fluent, natural, and informative English text. Each <snt> block should become one natural sentence, and the full <paragraph> should become a smooth, coherent paragraph. Do not omit or invent any facts, and avoid using the original attribute-value phrases verbatim; instead, render the content as well-written prose. Here is your input:\n\n<paragraph>\n<snt>\nName: The Wrestlers\nEat Type (The Wrestlers): restaurant\n</snt>\n<snt>\nArea (The Wrestlers): riverside\n</snt>\n<snt>\nFood (The Wrestlers): Italian\nPrice Range (The Wrestlers): moderate\nFamily Friendly (The Wrestlers): yes\n</snt>\n</paragraph>\n\n                Worker Output: The Wrestlers is a restaurant located by the riverside, offering a family-friendly atmosphere. This establishment specializes in Italian cuisine and is known for its moderate pricing, making it an appealing choice for diners seeking both quality and affordability.\n\nKeep your reply concise, avoid repetition, and use the following format:\nFEEDBACK:\n",
