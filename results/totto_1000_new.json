The next step is to realize this structured content as fluent, natural language prose, ensuring that all facts are included and flow well together.\n\n                Worker Input: Please convert the following structured content into fluent, human-like text, preserving all information and paragraph structure. Each <snt> block should be a polished sentence, and all sentences within a <paragraph> block should flow together naturally in one paragraph:\n\n<paragraph>\n<snt>\nGeneration: Third generation (FD)\n</snt>\n<snt>\nPower output (Third generation (FD)): 255 PS (188 kW; 252 hp)\nTorque (Third generation (FD)): 294 N\u22c5m (217 lbf\u22c5ft)\n</snt>\n</paragraph>\n\n                Worker Output: The vehicle in question belongs to the third generation, designated as FD. This generation delivers a power output of 255 PS, equivalent to 188 kW or 252 horsepower, and provides a torque of 294 newton-meters, or 217 pound-feet.\n\nKeep your reply concise, avoid repetition, and use the following format:\nFEEDBACK:\n",
