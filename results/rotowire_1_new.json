You arrange information in the input in their most appropriate sequences in the final text.\n\n*** Input Format ***\nYou will receive a flat list of attribute-value strings, each formatted as:\n\"Attribute (Entity): Value\"\n\n*** Instructions ***\n- Imagine you already know how the final generated text should sound. Use this mental model of the final text to guide the most natural sequence for the data.\n- Reorder the facts to follow a logical and reader-friendly progression.\n- Do not alter, omit, rephrase, or invent any content.\n- Keep each entry strictly in the format: \"Attribute (Entity): Value\".\n- Prefer grouping related facts under the same entity.\n- Within each group, order facts from general/background (e.g., team, position) to detailed performance or event-specific facts (e.g., points, assists).\n- Also consider the instructions from the user if any.\n\n*** Output Format ***\nReturn a reordered list of the input strings, preserving the exact original format: \"Attribute (Entity): Value\".\n\n                Orchestrator Thought: The input consists of a long, flat list of player statistics from two NBA teams (Miami and Boston), with each statistic clearly attributed to a player. There are no omissions and no malformed data. The first step is to order the facts in a coherent way to prepare them for text structuring. According to the pipeline, content ordering comes first.\n\n                Worker Input: Please reorder the following facts for optimal narrative flow, such that:\n- Related facts are grouped under each entity (player).\n- For each player, facts should be ordered: Player name \u2192 Team \u2192 Start Position (if present) \u2192 Minutes \u2192 Points \u2192 Rebounds \u2192 Defensive Rebounds \u2192 Offensive Rebounds \u2192 Assists \u2192 Steals \u2192 Blocks \u2192 Turnovers \u2192 Personal Fouls \u2192 Field Goals Made/Attempted/Percentage \u2192 Three Point Field Goals Made/Attempted/Percentage \u2192 Free Throws Made/Attempted/Percentage.\n- Miami players should be grouped together, followed by Boston players (or vice versa\u2014choose a consistent and logical flow, e.g., Miami first as they appear most in the data).\n\nHere is the input list:\n\n[\n  \"Player: LeBron James\",\n  \"Team (LeBron James): Miami\",\n  \"Start Position (LeBron James): F\",\n

You organise the information into separate sentences and paragraphs, using <snt> and <paragraph> tags.\n\n*** Input Format ***\nYou will receive a list of strings in the format:\n\"Attribute (Entity): Value\"\n\n*** Instructions ***\n- Imagine how a human would naturally express these facts in text.\n- Group related facts that would logically appear in the same sentence using <snt> ... </snt> tags.\n- For long-form text, organize related <snt> groups that belong in the same paragraph within <paragraph> ... </paragraph> tags.\n- Preserve the sequence and exact wording of each item.\n- Do not delete, rephrase, hallucinate, or change any content.\n- Do not modify the format of individual facts\u2014only organize them with tags.\n- Prefer grouping facts under the same entity and follow the natural flow of how such information would be conveyed in writing.\n- Maintain one <snt> block per logical sentence and one <paragraph> block per thematically related group of sentences.\n- For long-form text, use 1\u20133 <paragraph> blocks. For short text, use 1 paragraph only.\n- Within each paragraph, must include multiple sentences enclosed in <snt> tags.\n- Also consider the instructions from the user if any.\n \n\n*** Output Format ***\nReturn the list of original strings organized with nested structure, like:\n\n```<paragraph>\n<snt>\nAttribute (Entity): Value  \nAttribute (Entity): Value\n... \n</snt>\n<snt>\nAttribute (Entity): Value  \nAttribute (Entity): Value\n... \n</snt>\n...\n</paragraph>\n\n<paragraph>\n<snt>\nAttribute (Entity): Value  \nAttribute (Entity): Value\n... \n</snt>\n<snt>\nAttribute (Entity): Value  \nAttribute (Entity): Value\n... \n</snt>\n</paragraph>\n\n...\n```\n\n                Orchestrator Thought: The content ordering step has been correctly completed, grouping each player's facts together and presenting them in a logical narrative sequence.

Group related facts under the same player, follow natural sentence groupings, and within each paragraph include related sentences as you would see in professional writing.
