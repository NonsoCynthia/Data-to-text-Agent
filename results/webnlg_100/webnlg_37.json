The expectation is to convert this structure into a fluent, natural, and coherent paragraph about the film \"Super Capers,\" without omitting or adding any information. \n\nWorker Input: - Original Data: ['Super_Capers | starring | Michael_Rooker', 'Super_Capers | starring | Tom_Sizemore', 'Super_Capers | budget | 2000000.0', 'Super_Capers | writer | Ray_Griggs_(director)', 'Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)', 'Super_Capers | runtime | 98.0']\n- Ordered Content: ['Super_Capers | starring | Michael_Rooker', 'Super_Capers | starring | Tom_Sizemore', 'Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)', 'Super_Capers | writer | Ray_Griggs_(director)', 'Super_Capers | budget | 2000000.0', 'Super_Capers | runtime | 98.0']\n- Structured Content:\n<paragraph>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | starring | Michael_Rooker\n    Super_Capers | starring | Tom_Sizemore\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | director | Ray_Griggs_(director)\n    Super_Capers | writer | Ray_Griggs_(director)\n  </snt>\n  <snt>\n    Super_Capers | budget | 2000000.0\n    Super_Capers | runtime | 98.0\n  </snt>\n</paragraph>\n- No prior guardrail feedback for this stage.\n- Task: Convert the structured content into a fluent, natural, and coherent paragraph about the film \"Super Capers,\" ensuring all information is included and no extra information is added.', instruction='- Write a single, well-formed paragraph that presents all the information from the structured content.\n- Mention the film title, its stars (Michael Rooker and Tom Sizemore), director and writer (Ray Griggs), budget ($2,000,000), and runtime (98 minutes).\n- Ensure the text is clear, natural, and free of grammatical errors.\n- Do not omit or add any information. \n\nWorker Output: Super Capers is a film starring Michael Rooker and Tom Sizemore.
