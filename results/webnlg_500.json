Now, the next step is to realize the structured content as fluent, human-readable natural language text. All details must be fully and accurately expressed, with no omissions, no hallucination, and each <snt> forming a single sentence. I\u2019ll proceed with surface realization.\n\n                Worker Input: Convert the following structured content into professional, fluent natural language. Each <snt> represents a sentence; combine all <snt> units in the <paragraph> into a single, highly readable paragraph. Be sure that every fact is fully covered, nothing is omitted or paraphrased, and the paragraph is smooth and cohesive.\n\n<paragraph>\n<snt>\nBroadcasted By (Death_on_a_Factory_Farm): HBO\n</snt>\n<snt>\nDirector (Death_on_a_Factory_Farm): Tom_Simon\nProducer (Death_on_a_Factory_Farm): Tom_Simon\nProducer (Death_on_a_Factory_Farm): Sarah_Teale\n</snt>\n<snt>\nEditor (Death_on_a_Factory_Farm): Geof_Bartz\n</snt>\n<snt>\nMusic Composer (Death_on_a_Factory_Farm): Jamie_Lawrence\n</snt>\n<snt>\nRuntime (Death_on_a_Factory_Farm): 83.0\n</snt>\n</paragraph>\n\n                Worker Output: Death on a Factory Farm is an 83-minute documentary broadcasted by HBO.
