1. Content Ordering: {CO}
2. Text Structuring: {TS}
3. Surface Realization: {SR}

*** WORKFLOW POLICY ***
• Follow the sequence strictly: content ordering → text structuring → surface realization
• Never skip stages or reorder the sequence
• Only use worker names: 'content ordering', 'text structuring', 'surface realization', 'FINISH', or 'finalizer'
• Reassign to the same worker if guardrail feedback indicates incorrect output or fluency issues
• Advance to the next worker only when guardrail feedback confirms correctness
• Redo surface realization with improved instructions if guardrails indicate poor output quality
• Never return to previous workers once you've advanced in the pipeline
• Move to the next task if the same worker has been repeated 3 times
• Do not reassign to the same worker after receiving correct guardrail feedback unless the task remains incomplete

*** WORKER ASSIGNMENT CRITERIA ***
• Assign the next worker based on remaining work
• Return 'FINISH' or 'finalizer' if the task is complete or input is malformed/missing
• If guardrail feedback is 'CORRECT', proceed to the next pipeline worker
• If guardrail feedback indicates errors, reassign the same worker with revised instructions that explicitly address the feedback
• Use guardrail feedback to improve worker instructions and justify decisions in your Thought

*** WORKER INPUT REQUIREMENTS ***
• Provide each worker with the complete original input and full history of previous results
• When rerunning a worker due to guardrail feedback, incorporate that feedback into Worker Input
• Clearly specify your expectations and requirements for the worker's output
• Never invent new workers, task names, or data fields
• Add your instructions into your 'Thought'.

*** Instructions ***
- Use only your **reasoning and natural understanding** of the input. You must **not** use or simulate any programming code.
- Identify and select all key data. Make sure to connect them with the correct attributes and values.
- If an entity has multiple attributes, include all of them in the output.
- connect the titles and sections in the table to the entities mentioned the cells. Each data entry is important.
- Use field names, column headers, or semantic indicators as the attribute labels.
- Retain all data exactly as it appears — do not hallucinate, paraphrase, or summarize.
- For each line, format your output as: `"Attribute (Entity): Value"` (e.g., `"Points (TJ Warren): 29"`).
- Use full names or meaningful entity identifiers for clarity.
- Group related facts by entity or subject where appropriate for coherence.
- For the long or extended data, usually for the sports data, do not extract entries that do not have any value (e.g. N/A, None). Only extract the most relevant and impactful data.

*** INPUT FORMAT ***
You will receive a list of strings in the format:

*** CORE PRINCIPLES ***
• Think like a human writer: How would someone naturally group and present these facts?
• Group MULTIPLE related facts that would logically appear together in the same sentence
• Organize sentences that discuss related themes into the same paragraph
• NEVER put just one fact per sentence - this creates unnatural, choppy text
• Aim for multiple (2+) facts per sentence when they relate to the same entity or theme

*** GROUPING STRATEGY ***
1. **Sentence-level grouping (<snt>)**: Combine facts that:
   - Describe the same entity or concept
   - Share similar attributes (e.g., all technical details, all descriptive info)
   - Would naturally flow together in speech

2. **Paragraph-level grouping (<paragraph>)**: Combine sentences that:
   - Discuss the same general topic or theme
   - Follow a logical narrative flow
   - Would appear in the same paragraph in well-written text

*** INSTRUCTIONS ***
• Preserve the exact sequence and wording of each fact - do not modify content
• Do not delete, rephrase, hallucinate, or change any information
• Do not modify the format "Attribute (Entity): Value" - only add structural tags
• Each <snt> block must contain MULTIPLE facts (minimum 1, ideally 2-4)

# 4. **Maintain Appropriate Tone and Style**
#    - Write in third-person, formal, and informative style.
#    - Avoid bullet points, lists, or structured representations.
#    - Your output must sound like it was written by a professional writer or editor.

# *** Input Format ***
# You will receive content similar to this:

# Attribute (Entity): Value  
# Attribute (Entity): Value
# </snt>
# <snt>
# Attribute (Entity): Value
# </snt>
# </paragraph> ...```

# *** Output Instructions ***
# - Convert each <snt> into a fluent sentence.
# - Combine all sentences inside a <paragraph> block into a single cohesive paragraph.
# - Do NOT include <snt> or <paragraph> tags in your output.
# - Ensure clarity, grammatical correctness, and full factual coverage.
# - Avoid excessive repetition or mechanical phrasing.

# *** What to Avoid ***
# - Copying facts verbatim from the input
# - Adding any information not explicitly present in the data
# - Ignoring or merging paragraph-level structure
# - Generating one isolated sentence per fact
# - Including tag markers or structured formatting

# *** Output Format ***
# - Output should be fluent, factually complete text consisting of multiple coherent paragraphs (if <paragraph> tags are present).
# - If only <snt> blocks are present, return a sentence per <snt>, separated by line breaks or formatted as flowing text.
# - The final result must be grammatically sound, semantically accurate, and naturally readable.

# Transform structured content with <snt> and <paragraph> tags into accurate, information-dense, natural language text that reads like an encyclopedia entry or technical reference.

# *** CORE OBJECTIVE ***
# Generate compact, expertly-written text that efficiently packs multiple facts into well-constructed sentences. Your output should sound like it was written by a domain expert who values precision and conciseness.

# *** TARGET STYLE ***
# - **Information Density**: Combine multiple related facts into single, complex sentences
# - **Expert Tone**: Similar to Wikipedia entries or technical references
# - **Natural Flow**: Use participial phrases, relative clauses, and connecting words
# - **Precision**: Maintain exact technical terms and numerical values

# *** SENTENCE CONSTRUCTION STRATEGY ***
# 1. **Combine Facts Strategically**: Don't create one sentence per <snt> block. Instead, weave facts from multiple <snt> blocks into information-rich sentences.
# 2. **Use Complex Structures**: Employ subordinate clauses, participial phrases, and appositives to pack information efficiently.
# 3. **Connecting Patterns**: Use words like "with", "having", "featuring", "while" to link related information.
# 4. **Vary Sentence Openings**: Avoid repetitive "The X..." patterns.

# *** WRITING GUIDELINES ***
# **Information Integration:**
# - Merge related facts from different <snt> blocks when logical
# - Present information in natural chronological or categorical order  
# - Use technical precision - preserve exact values and terminology
# - Eliminate unnecessary articles and verbose phrasing

# **Sentence Patterns to Use:**
# - "Entity + discovery details + technical specifications"
# - "Entity + descriptive phrase + additional characteristics"
# - "With/Having + specifications, Entity + other properties"

# **What to Preserve:**
# - All factual content from every <snt> block
# - Exact numerical values and technical terms
# - Logical grouping established by <paragraph> structure

# **What to Eliminate:**
# - Redundant words ("the asteroid", "it has", "as of")
# - Unnecessary explanatory text
# - Simple, choppy sentence structures
# - Added units or clarifications not in the source

# *** EXAMPLE ***
# **Input:**
# ```<paragraph>

# </snt>
# <snt>
# Goals Scored (Maria Rodriguez): 23

*** Task ***
Determine whether the agent has correctly extracted relevant content from structured data and expressed it as clear, factual, human-readable statements.

- All selected content must be present in the original structured input (e.g., list, XML, tables, or JSON).
- No information should be hallucinated, omitted, paraphrased, or fabricated.
- Entity names and attribute labels must accurately reflect the source content (e.g., use real player/team names, and appropriate field labels).
- Redundant or irrelevant fields should be avoided — only include meaningful and informative content.
- All facts must be grouped coherently by entity when appropriate.

*** How to Judge ***
1. Verify that each output item exists in the input.
2. Check that entity and attribute labels are correctly assigned and formatted.
3. Ensure no critical information is missing or misrepresented.
4. Confirm that the agent did not introduce any code or unnatural transformations.
