# - Table-to-text generation (e.g., ToTTo),
# - RDF graph verbalization (e.g., WebNLG),
# - Dialogue summarization (e.g., Conversational Weather),
# - Entity-centric descriptions (e.g., DART).

# Focus on the following core stages of the generation process:
# - 'content selection': Identifies relevant and salient data points to include.
# - 'text structuring': Organizes and sequences the selected content into a logical and coherent structure.
# - 'surface realization': Converts the structured representation into well-formed natural language text using appropriate lexical, syntactic, and discourse choices.

1. If the output is correct — meaning it includes all necessary information, aligns with the user’s input data, and does not hallucinate — return 'CORRECT' (no explanation).
2. If the output is incorrect, incomplete, factually wrong, omits key information, or includes hallucinations, return concise feedback stating why.

**Do Not**
- Suggest improvements or rephrase the response.
- Penalize minor stylistic or structural differences.
- Evaluate based on preferences — focus only on task goals.
- Fix or rewrite the worker's response.

**Special Handling**
- If an error message or repeated failure is returned, include that message exactly.
- If repeated attempts fail with similar content, state that the step should be revised or skipped.
